" Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.",English
"""Nature"" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.",English
"The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.",English
"Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.",English
"[1] The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"".",English
"[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.",English
"[3][4] 
The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.",English
"During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.",English
"[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention†: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).",English
"However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.",English
"[1] Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife.",English
"Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objectsÄîthe way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.",English
"It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wildernessÄîwild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.",English
"For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, ""human nature"" or ""the whole of nature"".",English
"This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.",English
"Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.",English
"[1] Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research.",English
"Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall.",English
"Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.",English
"[7] Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre.",English
71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans.,English
"The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.",English
Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions.,English
The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates.,English
"The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field.",English
"This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase.",English
"Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.",English
"The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[8] which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.",English
"Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[9] and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.",English
[10][11] Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the earth.,English
"The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed.",English
"The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.",English
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.,English
Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock.,English
"Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface.",English
"Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.",English
"After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.",English
"Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion.",English
"These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.",English
"Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54†billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets.",English
[12] The moon formed roughly 20†million years later.,English
"Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust.",English
Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.,English
"Condensing water vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources.",English
[13] The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4†billion years ago.,English
"[14] Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent.",English
"Roughly 750†million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart.",English
"The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540†million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180†million years ago.",English
"[16] During the Neoproterozoic era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice sheets.",English
"This hypothesis has been termed the ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530Äì540†million years ago.",English
[17] Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.,English
"[18] The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals.",English
"Over the past 66†million years, mammalian life diversified.",English
"[19] Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.",English
"[15] The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.",English
"By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300†million years to culminate.",English
"The present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred.",English
"[20][21] Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100†years.",English
"[22] The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.",English
[23][24][25] The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem.,English
The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.,English
"Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc.",English
The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude.,English
The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface.,English
"As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface.",English
"The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.",English
"Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.",English
"[26] Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.",English
These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones.,English
"Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.",English
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects.,English
"Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation.",English
"Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.",English
Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather.,English
"Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit.",English
"Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.",English
"The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially latitude.",English
A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region.,English
"There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes.",English
"Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane.",English
"Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun.",English
This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit.,English
"At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.",English
"Weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days.",English
"[27] Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.",English
[28] Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.,English
"[29] In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam.",English
Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.,English
"[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.",English
"[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%.",English
"Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.",English
"An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere.",English
"Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas.",English
"More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep.",English
"Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.",English
"Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.",English
[33][34] This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.,English
"[35] The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.",English
"Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names.",English
"There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean.",English
Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.,English
"A lake (from Latin word lacus) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all.",English
"On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.",English
"[36][37] The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane.",English
"It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds.",English
"Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation.",English
Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers.,English
"In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.",English
"All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.",English
"A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.",English
"A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.",English
Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed.,English
"While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents.",English
"These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.",English
"A river is a natural watercourse,[38] usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.",English
"In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water.",English
"Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river.",English
Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England.,English
"Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.",English
[39] A river is part of the hydrological cycle.,English
"Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).",English
"A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks.",English
"In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide.",English
"Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration.",English
The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone.,English
"Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity.",English
"The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.",English
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way.,English
[41] The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.,English
Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem.,English
"Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.",English
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment.,English
"Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: ""Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the ""community"") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.",English
: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.,English
"""[42] Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain, and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment.",English
"[43] The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature dichotomy and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope.",English
[44] A smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem.,English
"For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it.",English
"A macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.",English
[45] Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity.,English
"Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, national forests, national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas.",English
"Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, and solitude.",English
"Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,[46] and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere).",English
"They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.",English
"Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction.",English
[47] Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.,English
"Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce.",English
An entity with these properties is generally considered life.,English
"However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential.",English
Human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.,English
"The biosphere is the part of Earth's outer shellÄîincluding land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphereÄîwithin which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform.",English
"From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air).",English
"The entire Earth contains over 75†billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8‡ó1013†kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.",English
"[48] Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.",English
"[49] More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,[50] and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50†million.",English
"[51][52][53] The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.",English
[54][55] The total number of species is in rapid decline.,English
"[56][57][58] The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5†billion years ago,[61][62][63] during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.",English
[64] These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits.,English
"Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.",English
Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct.,English
"However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species.",English
Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.,English
[64] When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.,English
[65] The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer.,English
The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.,English
"[66] Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms.",English
"With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.",English
"The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.",English
"[67] Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see.",English
"They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.",English
"These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.",English
"[68]
Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse.",English
"The combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer[69] ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including outer space.",English
[70] They form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem.,English
"However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.",English
"Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals.",English
"In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia.",English
"Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms.",English
"However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts.",English
"Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,[71][72] and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.",English
"Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil flora, remnants of plant life from a previous era.",English
"People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain.",English
"Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as native flora and agricultural and garden flora, the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated.",English
"Some types of ""native flora"" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced.",English
This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.,English
Another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds.,English
"Though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize ""useless"" plants, the informal use of the word ""weeds"" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature.",English
"Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as domestic, farm animals, wild animals, pests, etc.",English
according to their relationship to human life.,English
Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things.,English
"Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists.",English
"They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae.",English
"They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.",English
With a few exceptionsÄîmost notably the two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoansÄîanimals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues.,English
"These include muscles, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a nervous system, which sends and processes signals.",English
There is also typically an internal digestive chamber.,English
The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.,English
"This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.",English
"Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large.",English
"Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and ""made environments"" is not clear cut except at the extremes.",English
"Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.",English
The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards.,English
"In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment.",English
There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.,English
"[73] Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills.",English
Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.,English
Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities.,English
The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.,English
"[74][75] Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people.",English
Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE.,English
"Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.",English
"Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,[76] most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.",English
"The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.",English
"[77] Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores.",English
"That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty.",English
"Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics.",English
"Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.",English
[78] Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history.,English
An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618Äì907).,English
The tradition of representing nature as it is became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.,English
"Although natural wonders are celebrated in the Psalms and the Book of Job, wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the Romantic movement.",English
British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings.,English
"Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings.",English
"William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place.",English
Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.,English
[79] This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world.,English
"A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis, the imitation of nature.",English
Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature.,English
"As David Rothenburg writes, ""The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see"".",English
"[80]:281 Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand.",English
"For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be ""physics""Äîthe name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the ""study of nature"".",English
Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed.,English
It constitutes the observable universe.,English
The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass.,English
The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy.,English
[81] The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.,English
The behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws.,English
These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe.,English
The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants[82] that appear to be static across the observable universe.,English
"[83] The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.",English
"Outer space, also simply called space, refers to the relatively empty regions of the Universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies.",English
Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations).,English
"There is no discrete boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude.",English
"Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at what is known as the heliopause.",English
"Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.",English
"There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors.",English
"Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft.",English
Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.,English
"Although Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.",English
"[84] For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life.",English
"At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.",English
"If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.",English
"[85] Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it.",English
"But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.",English
"[86] Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar Earth analogs Äì planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.",English
[87] Media: Organizations: Philosophy:   Wikipedia (/Àåw…™k…™ÀàpiÀêdi…ô/ (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-…ô or /Àåw…™ki-/ (listen) wik-ee-) is a multilingual open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system.,English

"Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.",English
"Sanger coined its name[5][6] as a portmanteau of ""wiki"" and ""encyclopedia"".",English
"It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed.",English

"[8][9] Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male.",English
[4] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.,English
"[10] In 2006, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.",English
"[11] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability, based on its unique structure, curation and absence of commercial bias.",English
"[4] In 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.",English
"[12] Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful.",English
"[13] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.",English
"[14] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company.",English
"Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.",English
"[15][16] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.",English
"[17] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[18][19] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.",English
"[20] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.",English
"[21] The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001,[22] and January 13, 2001,[23] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[14] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[24] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.",English
"[18] Wikipedia's policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[25] was codified in its first few months.",English
"Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.",English
"[18] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.",English
"[26] Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing.",English
"Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 by the end of 2004.",English
"[27] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia.",English
"The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made during the Ming Dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600†years.",English
"[28] Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.",English
"[29] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.",English
"[30][31] Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.",English
"[32] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.",English
[33] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.,English
"[34] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called ""low-hanging fruit""Äîtopics that clearly merit an articleÄîhave already been created and built up extensively.",English
"[35][36][37]  In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.",English
[38][39] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.,English
"[40] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.",English
"[41] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from ""a little more than 36,000 writers"" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011.",English
"In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".",English
"[42] A 2013 article titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" in MIT Technology Review questioned this claim.",English
"The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae.",English
"[43] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline.",English
"[44] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated ""Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis"".",English
"[45] In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list of the most popular websites in the US, according to comscore Networks.",English
"With 42.9†million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11).",English
"This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was number 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3†million unique visitors.",English
"[46] As of March†2020[update], Wikipedia has rank 13[3] among websites in terms of popularity according to Alexa Internet.",English
"In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month.",English
"[47] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia has 18†billion page views and nearly 500†million unique visitors a month, ""according to the ratings firm comScore"".",English
"[8] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through ""stigmergic accumulation"".",English
"[48][49]  On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States CongressÄîthe Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)Äîby blacking out its pages for 24 hours.",English
[50] More than 162†million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content.,English
"[51][52] On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it ""had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year.",English
There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013.,English
"Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.",English
"""[53] Varma added that ""While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.",English
"""[53] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, ""If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].",English
"""[53] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most popular websites globally.",English
"[54] In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument; and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia.",English
"In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.",English
"[55][56] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16†GB of article text from the English Wikipedia have been encoded into synthetic DNA.",English
"[57] Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle[note 3] regarding the security of its content.",English
"[60] It started almost entirely openÄîanyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account.",English
Modifications to all articles would be published immediately.,English
"As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.",English
"Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases.",English
"For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.",English
"[61] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.",English
"[62][63] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.",English
[64] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.,English
"[65] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page protection policies as ""[p]erhaps the most important"" means at Wikipedia's disposal to ""regulate its market of ideas"".",English
"[66] In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions.",English
"For example, the German Wikipedia maintains ""stable versions"" of articles,[67] which have passed certain reviews.",English
"Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the ""pending changes"" system in December 2012.",English
"[68] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.",English
"[69] Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others.",English
"The ""History"" page of each article links to each revision.",English
"[note 4][70] On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page.",English
"Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a ""watchlist"" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes.",English
"""New pages patrol"" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.",English
"[71] In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor ""creative construction"" over ""creative destruction"".",English
[72] Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism.,English
The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor.,English
Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam.,English
[73] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page.,English
"Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect.",English
"Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.",English
[74] Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.,English
"[75][76] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.",English
"[77] In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005.",English
Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F.,English
Kennedy.,English
[77] The article remained uncorrected for four months.,English
"[77] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation.",English
"Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.",English
"[78][79] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as ""a flawed and irresponsible research tool"".",English
"[77] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.",English
"[80] In 2010, Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0, to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will.",English
"On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing.",English
"[81][82] Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as ""edit warring"".",English
[83][84] The process is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.,English
"[85] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[86] conflict based[87] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[88] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.",English
Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests.,English
"Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.",English
"Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the ""five pillars"" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.",English
"Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.",English
[89] Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.,English
"Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia.",English
They have since diverged to some extent.,English
"[67] According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.",English
"[90] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of ""notability"",[91] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.",English
"Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.",English
[92] It must not present original research.,English
A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source.,English
"Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as ""verifiability, not truth"" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.",English
"[93] This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.",English
"[94] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.",English
"[95] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.",English
This is known as a neutral point of view (NPOV).,English
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.,English
"[96][97] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.",English
"[98] Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with ""administrator"",[99][100] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing.",English
"Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).",English
"[101][102] Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.",English
[103] Bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.,English
"Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances.",English
"To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,[note 5] or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a ""request for comment"".",English
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process.,English
"Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.",English
"Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[104] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.",English
"Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).",English
"Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).",English
Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.,English
"When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.",English
"[105] Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated ""Talk"" page.",English
"These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.",English
"[106] Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[107] although not always with entirely negative connotations.",English
"[108] The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as ""anti-elitism"".",English
[109] Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work.,English
"These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work.",English
[110] Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.,English
"[111] As Wikipedia grew, ""Who writes Wikipedia?""",English
became one of the questions frequently asked on the project.,English
"[112] Jimmy Wales once argued that only ""a community†... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers"" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore ""much like any traditional organization"".",English
"[113] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: ""According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.",English
"""[114] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.",English
"[115] The English Wikipedia has 6,238,672 articles, 40,838,998 registered editors, and 141,020 active editors.",English
An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.,English
"Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions.",English
"Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a ""baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references"".",English
"[116] Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,[116] as ""participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation"",[117] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.",English
"A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site"".",English
"[118] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that ""[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users†... 524 people†... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.",English
"""[113] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by ""outsiders"", while most editing and formatting is done by ""insiders"".",English
"[113] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[119][120] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.",English
"[121] According to a 2009 study, there is ""evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content"".",English
[122] Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male.,English
"Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.",English
"[123] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage females to become Wikipedia contributors.",English
"Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.",English
"[124] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, wrote in The New York Times that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ""ugly, intimidating behavior"".",English
[125] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.,English
"[126] There are currently 317 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias).",English
"As of January 2021, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, Swedish, German, French, and Dutch Wikipedias.",English
"[127] The second and third largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013 had created about half the articles in the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias.",English
The latter are both languages of the Philippines.,English
"In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Waray, Vietnamese, Japanese, Egyptian Arabic, Chinese, Arabic, Ukrainian and Portugese), seven more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Serbian, Indonesian, Norwegian (Bokm‡•l), Korean and Finnish), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000.",English
"[128][129] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.2 million articles.",English
"As of January†2019[update], according to Alexa, the English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia) receives approximately 57% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Russian: 9%; Chinese: 6%; Japanese: 6%; Spanish: 5%).",English
"[3] Distribution of the 55,727,399 articles in different language editions (as of January 30, 2021)[130] The unit for the numbers in bars is articles.",English
"Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition).",English
These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g.,English
colour versus color)[132] or points of view.,English
"[133] Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as ""neutral point of view"", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.",English
"[134][135][136] Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language"".",English
"[137] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all.",English
"They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).",English
"[138] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[139] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.",English
"[140] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.",English
It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition.,English
"For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.",English
"Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles.",English
"[142] Articles available in more than one language may offer ""interwiki links"", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.",English
A study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world.,English
"It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia.",English
"[141] On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled ""The Future of Wikipedia"", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that ""[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.",English
"""[143] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia).",English
"The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down.",English
"The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.",English
"Should this attrition have continued unabated at the quoted trend rate of approximately 20,000 editors lost within seven years, by 2021 there would be only 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia.",English
"[143] In contrast, the trend analysis published in The Economist presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000.",English
[143] No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.,English
"[144] Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014[update].",English
[145][146] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias.,English
"In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of ""truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods"".",English
"[147] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.",English
"[148][149][150] Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an ""ax to grind"" on the topic.",English
"[147][151] A 2008 article in Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.",English
"[152] In 2006, the Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism in the English Wikipedia.",English
"[153] Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.",English
"[154] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that ""the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.",English
"""[155] Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects ""a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors"" in science articles, ""Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.",English
"""[156] Others raised similar critiques.",English
"[157] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica,[158][159] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.",English
"[160] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a ""flawed study design"" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study ""statistical power"" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4†‡ó 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).",English
"[161] As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia ""makes no guarantee of validity"" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.",English
"[162] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity,[163] the insertion of false information,[164] vandalism, and similar problems.",English
"Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: ""If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.""",English
"He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports.",English
"However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.",English
[165] Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.,English
"[166] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.",English
[167] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.,English
"[168] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of ""fake news"" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.",English
"[169] Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.",English

In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal, to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.",English
"[172] The article stated that: ""Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement.",English
"Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.",English
"'""[172][173][174][175][176] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.",English
"[177] A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a ""general source"" that ""can be a real boon"" in ""coming up to speed in the law governing a situation"" and, ""while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources"".",English
"[178] Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[179] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.",English
"[180][181] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.",English
[182] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved.,English
"""For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia,"" he said.",English
"[183] In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.",English
"[184] In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google,[185] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are ""the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything"".",English
"In contrast, academic writing[clarification needed] in Wikipedia has evolved in recent years and has been found to increase student interest, personal connection to the product, creativity in material processing, and international collaboration in the learning process.",English
"[186] On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled ""Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia"", stated that ""Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.",English
"""[187] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.",English
"[187] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled ""Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?",English
""", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: ""Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.",English
"""[188] Beck added that: ""Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'.",English
"Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.",English
"""[188] In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that the quality of a Wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit coordination.",English
"[189] For instance, when contributors rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry.",English
"Roy Rosenzweig, a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its ""clear and engaging prose"", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing.",English
"[190] Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online, he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised ""McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.""",English
"By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds ""both verbose and dull"".",English
"Rosenzweig also criticized the ""wafflingÄîencouraged by the NPOV policyÄî[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history"".",English
"While generally praising the article on William Clarke Quantrill, he quoted its conclusion as an example of such ""waffling"", which then stated: ""Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero.",English
"""[190] Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style.",English
"Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented, ""Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 percent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage.",English
"""[191] A study of Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University.",English
"The study was limited to those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluded those written at the ""start"" class or ""stub"" class level.",English
"Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that ""Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing"".",English
"[192] The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: ""inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information"".",English
"[193] Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article.",English
"Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.",English
"[194] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).",English
"[195][196] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.",English
"The 'Wikipedia is not censored' policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy.",English
"The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[197] and Pakistan,[198] amongst other countries.",English
A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field:[199] These numbers refer only to the number of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones.,English
"Through its ""Wikipedia Loves Libraries"" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.",English
[200] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics.,English
"There was a greater concentration of females in the People and Arts category, while males focus more on Geography and Science.",English
[201] Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven.,English
Africa is the most underrepresented.,English
"[202] Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.",English
[203] An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.,English
[204] Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address.,English
"[126] When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, systemic bias may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors.",English
"In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example ""biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare"".",English
"[42] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.",English
"[43] Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally,[vague] for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions.",English
"[205] It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture, inclining to be young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing.",English
"Biases, intrinsically, may include an overemphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events.",English
"[205] Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford, in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution.",English
[206][207] His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring.,English
"Yasseri contended that simple reverts or ""undo"" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting ""reverting/reverted pairs"" or ""mutually reverting edit pairs"".",English
"Such a ""mutually reverting edit pair"" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the ""mutually reverting edit pairs"".",English
The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia.,English
"The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism, and Muhammad.",English
"[207] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.",English
[207] Researchers from Washington University developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics.,English
"The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact.",English
[208][209] Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.,English
"Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.",English
"The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles.",English
It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.,English
"The Wikipedia article about Virgin KillerÄîa 1976 album from the German rock band ScorpionsÄîfeatures a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl.",English
The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries.,English
"In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a ""blacklist"" it supplies to British internet service providers.",English
"[210] In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.",English
"[211][212] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted ""obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children"", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.",English
[213] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.,English
[213] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.,English
"[214] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[215] saying that Wikipedia did not have ""material we would deem to be illegal.",English
"If we did, we would remove it.",English
"""[215] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community.",English
"After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status.",English
"He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".",English
"[216] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.",English
"[217] One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a ""private citizen"" rather than a ""public figure"" in the eyes of the law.",English
"[218][note 6] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life (""meatspace"").",English
A particular problem occurs in the case of a relatively unimportant individual and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.,English
"In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka ""Tron"", a deceased hacker.",English
"On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.",English
"[219] Wikipedia has a ""Volunteer Response Team"" that uses the OTRS system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties.",English
"This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.",English
[220] Wikipedia has been described as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment.,English
[221][222] The perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap in Wikipedia editors.,English
"[223] In 2014, a female editor who requested a separate space on Wikipedia to discuss improving civility had her proposal referred to by a male editor using the words ""the easiest way to avoid being called a cunt is not to act like one"".",English
"[221] Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks.",English
The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.,English
"[224] The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7†million and expenses of almost $29†million, with assets of $37.2†million and liabilities of about $2.3†million.",English
"[225] In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.",English
"[226] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, ""Information, like air, wants to be free.",English
"""[227][228] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who ""said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority.",English
We are really pushing toward more transparency†... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.',English
"Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities,"" Walsh said.",English
"[227] Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the ""superprotection"" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.",English
[229] Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December.,English
"Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: ""It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority†... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words.",English
"""[230] Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates.",English
"These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and WikimÈdia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups.",English
"These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.",English
"The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.",English
"[231] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection.",English
"MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.",English
"Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.",English
"Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske.",English
The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand.,English
"In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.",English
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed[232] to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.,English
"In April 2005, a Lucene extension[233][234] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching.",English
"The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1,[235][needs update] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3.",English
"[236] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.",English
"[237][238][239][240] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as ""slow and buggy"".",English
[241] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.,English
"Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.",English
"[242][243][244] One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson†[sv], creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.",English
"[245] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).",English
[246] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors.,English
An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.,English
"[243] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was reported edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.",English
[247] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.,English
"[248] According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.",English
"[249] Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000-page requests per second, depending on the time of the day.",English
"[250][needs update] As of 2019[update], page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers.",English
"[251][needs update] Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available.",English
"[252] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.",English
"The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia.",English
"To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.",English
[citation needed] Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu).,English
"[253][254][needs update] As of December†2009[update], there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.",English
"[255] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia.",English
"[256][257] in 2017, Wikipedia had installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.",English
"[258] Following growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported,[43] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.",English
"[259] Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized ""Thank"" tab which were developed to ameliorate issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success.",English
"[43][241] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.",English
"[260] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45†million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8†million and 11.3†million dollars annually.",English
"[260] In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by Bloomberg News as being at $77†million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08†million and $19.2†million annually.",English
"[260] Community-produced news publications include the English Wikipedia's The Signpost, founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator, and former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees.",English
"[261] It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikimedia Commons.",English
"Similar publications are the German-language Kurier, and the Portugese-language Correio da WikipÈdia.",English
"Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the Wikiworld webcomic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors.",English
There are also several publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as Wikimedia Diff and This Month in Education.,English
"When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.",English
[262] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL.,English
"This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.",English
"In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals.",English
The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web.,English
The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.,English
"[263] Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.",English
(A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.),English
"In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.",English
[264][265][266][267] The handling of media files (e.g.,English
image files) varies across language editions.,English
"Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g.",English
in Japanese copyright law).,English
Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g.,English
"Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.",English
Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.,English
"[268] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia.",English
This position has been successfully defended in court.,English
"[269][270] Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.",English
"The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.",English
"Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.",English
"[281] Wikipedia publishes ""dumps"" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007[update] there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images.",English
"[282] Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public.",English
"According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.",English
[283] Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection.,English
"Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Mˆller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.",English
"[8] The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, ""Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent.",English
And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.,English
"""[8] The New York Times reports that Mˆller has assigned ""a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile"", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation.",English
"One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the ""worry"" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.",English
[8] Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.,English
"[284] At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia.",English
"Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.",English
"[228] The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.",English
"[285] The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.",English
"[286] Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service.",English
"In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices.",English
"In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,[287] located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices or WebOS-based devices.",English
Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged.,English
"Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (see Wikipedia:Metadata), such as geoinformation.",English
[288][289] Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries.,English
[290] It was discontinued in February 2018.,English
[291] Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.,English
The number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this.,English
Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.,English
[43] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this.,English
Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.,English
"[292][293] In 2017Äì18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.",English
"Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, ""YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.",English
"""[12] As of November 2020, Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.03 and the average daily time on site as 3:46 minutes.",English
"[3] In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating ""With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month [...] Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.",English
"""[8] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.",English
"[294] In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[295] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.",English
"[296] About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google,[297] a good portion of which is related to academic research.",English
[298] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365†million at the end of 2009.,English
[299] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.,English
[300] In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4†billion if it ran advertisements.,English
"[301] According to ""Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011"", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders.",English
"Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results.",English
About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.,English

[365][366] Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.,English
[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.,English
"Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.",English
"[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.",English
"A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning.",English
"The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.",English
"Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.",English
"[4][5] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.",English
Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.,English
It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks.,English
"For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed.",English
"For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms.",English
"In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.",English
[6] The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available.,English
"In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid.",English
This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers.,English
"For example, to train a system for the task of digital character recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has often been used.",English
"[6] Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to the learning system: Other approaches have been developed which don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.",English
"For example topic modeling, dimensionality reduction or meta learning.",English
"[7] As of 2020, deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning.",English
"[6] The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.",English
"[8][9] A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.",English
"[10] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.",English
"[11] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.",English
"[12] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.""[13] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms.",English
"This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?""",English
"is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".",English
"[14] Modern day machine learning has two objectives, one is to classify data based on models which have been developed, the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models.",English
A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles.,English
"Where as, a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.",English
"[15] As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence.",English
"In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data.",English
"They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.",English
"[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.",English
"[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning.",English
Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.,English
"[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.",English
"[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.",English
[19]:708Äì710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time.,English
"This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton.",English
Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.,English
"[19]:25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s.",English
The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature.,English
"It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.",English
"[20] As of 2020, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a subfield of AI.",English
"[21][22][16] The main disagreement is whether all of ML is part of AI, as this would mean that anyone using ML could claim they are using AI.",English
Others have the view that not all of ML is part of AI[23][24][25] where only an 'intelligent' subset of ML is part of AI.,English
[26] The question to what is the difference between ML and AI is answered by Judea Pearl in The Book of Why.,English
"[27] Accordingly ML learns and predicts based on passive observations, whereas AI implies an agent  interacting with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.",English
"[30] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases).",English
"Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy.",English
"Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge.",English
"Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.",English
Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.,English
"Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).",English
"[31] The difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.",English
"Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.",English
"Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.",English
"[32] According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.",English
[33] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.,English
"[33] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[34] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest.",English
"Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.",English
[35] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.,English
"[3][36] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set.",English
The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.,English
The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.,English
"Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms.",English
"Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common.",English
The biasÄìvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.,English
"For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data.",English
"If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data.",English
"If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases.",English
"But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.",English
"[37] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.",English
"In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time.",English
There are two kinds of time complexity results.,English
Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time.,English
Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.,English
"The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.",English
Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.,English
"[38] The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples.",English
"Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal.",English
"In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix.",English
"Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.",English
[39] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.,English
An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.,English
"[13] Types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.",English
"[40] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range.",English
"As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.",English
"Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are.",English
"It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.",English
"Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.",English
"The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized.",English
"Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.",English
"A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics, such as finding the probability density function.",English
[41] Though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.,English
"Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar.",English
"Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters.",English
Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.,English
Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data).,English
"Some of the training examples are missing training labels,  yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.",English
"In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.",English
[42] Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.,English
"Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms.",English
"In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP).",English
Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.,English
"[43] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible.",English
Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.,English
Self-learning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).,English
[44] It is a learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice.,English
"The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations.",English
The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.,English
"[45]
The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: It is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a.",English
There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment.,English
The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation.,English
"The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment.",English
"After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.",English
[46] Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.,English
[47] Classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis.,English
"Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions.",English
"This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution.",English
"This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.",English
Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised.,English
"In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data.",English
"Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning.",English
"In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data.",English
"Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization[48] and various forms of clustering.",English
[49][50][51] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.,English
"Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.",English
"Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.",English
"[52] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features.",English
It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.,English
[53] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process.,English
"However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features.",English
"An alternative is to discover such features or representations thorough examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.",English
"Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and is assumed to be a sparse matrix.",English
The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.,English
[54] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm.,English
Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts.,English
"In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs.",English
"For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary.",English
Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising.,English
"The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.",English
"[55] In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.",English
"[56] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.",English
"Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.",English
"[57] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity.",English
"This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless it has been aggregated appropriately.",English
"Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.",English
[58] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.,English
"[59] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set.",English
"Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection).",English
Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.,English
"In developmental robotics, robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans.",English
"These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies and imitation.",English
Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.,English
"It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"".",English
"[60] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge.",English
The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system.,English
This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.,English
"[61] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.",English
"Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli≈Ñski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.",English
"[62] For example, the rule

 found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat.",English
Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements.,English
"In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics.",English
"In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.",English
"Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning.",English
They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.,English
"[63] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses.",English
"Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples.",English
"Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.",English
Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing.,English
Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.,English
[64][65][66] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.,English
"[67] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.",English
"Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions.",English
Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.,English
"Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.",English
"Such systems ""learn"" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.",English
"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.",English
"Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another.",English
An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.,English
"In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.",English
"The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"".",English
Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds.,English
The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection.,English
Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.,English
"Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers.",English
Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.,English
"Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.",English
The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would.,English
"However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology.",English
"Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.",English
Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network.,English
This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing.,English
Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.,English
[68] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).,English
"It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning.",English
"Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels.",English
Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.,English
"In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.",English
"In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.",English
"Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression.",English
"Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.",English
"[69]  An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting.",English
"In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.",English
Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features.,English
"Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares.",English
"The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression.",English
"When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.",English
"A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG).",English
"For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.",English
"Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.",English
Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning.,English
"Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks.",English
Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.,English
"A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.",English
"In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.",English
"[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.",English
"[73] Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well.",English
"Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set.",English
"Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service.",English
Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.,English
Trained models derived from biased data can result in skewed or undesired predictions.,English
Algorithmic bias is a potential result from data not fully prepared for training.,English
"Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server.",English
This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices.,English
"For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.",English
"[74] There are many applications for machine learning, including: In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%.",English
A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1†million.,English
"[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.",English
[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.,English
"[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.",English
"[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.",English
[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.,English
"[81] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.",English
"[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.",English
"[85] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.",English
[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.,English
[87][88] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature.,English
"While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.",English
[89] Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases.,English
A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data.,English
"When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.",English
[90] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.,English
[91][92] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.,English
"[93][94] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[95] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.",English
[96] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.,English
"[97] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.",English
"[98] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.",English
"[99] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""ThereÄôs nothing artificial about AI...ItÄôs inspired by people, itÄôs created by people, andÄîmost importantlyÄîit impacts people.",English
"It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.Äù[100] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set.",English
"In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model.",English
"In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.",English
"[101] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively.",English
"Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR).",English
"However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.",English
The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability.,English
"TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).",English
[102] Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions.,English
"Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.",English
"[103] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.",English
[104][105] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.,English
The evolvement of AI systems raises a lot questions in the realm of ethics and morality.,English
"AI can be well equipped in making decisions in certain fields such technical and scientific which rely
heavily on data and historical information.",English
These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning.,English
"[106] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.",English
"[107][108] Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care.",English
There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines.,English
"This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits.",English
"For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes.",English
"There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.",English
"[109] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.",English
"[110] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.",English
"[111] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.",English
"[112][113] Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following: 
.we're all looking for quick ways to become more fluent in english i know i understand what happens is that there are just a few words circling our brain and we need to make this entire conversation using just awesome amazing cool or epic so how about we learn some smart new english words that you can use in your daily life and elevate your vocabulary in minutes.",English
so today we're going to learn 10 new smart words their meanings root words and example sentences so let's get going  hey everyone this is  and you're watching.,English
and in this video i'm gonna give you 10 smart words for daily use and at the end of this video.,English
i'm also going to give you a smart tip to sound really fluent smart word number.,English
one is swamped swamped means drowning or flooding but swamped is often used in the context of work like i'm swamped with work i have too much work to do i've been swamped with work this entire week i've barely had time to breathe now let's look at the root of this word.,English
swamp is a piece of wetland and if somebody steps in the wrong place on a swamp they could easily drown and the verb form of swamp means to sink so here's how you can use this word.,English
let's say you have a lot of assignments and you have a test coming up and your friends come to you and they say.,English
hey why don't you hang out with us you can say to them i'm so sorry but i'm swamped with work or i'm swamped some other words that you can use in place of swamped are i've got too much to do.,English
there's too much on my plate i'm drowning in work.,English
i'm deluged with assignments smart word number two is catch-22 now i'm sure you've heard this word before catch-22 means an impossible situation in which you can't do one thing unless you've done the other and you can't do the other because you haven't done the first have.,English
i confused you so let me give you some examples a catch-22 situation is when you don't get a job without having work experience.,English
but you can't get experience until you get a job catch-22 was coined by joseph heller in his famous book of the same name catch-22 when he was describing some contradictory rules that were applicable to soldiers during world war two.,English
another example of catch-22 is you need a bank loan because you don't have enough.,English
money but you wouldn't get that bank loan unless you prove to the bank that you have enough money so next time you're stuck in a tricky situation remember.,English
to use the word catch-22.,English
and get these admiring looks from your friends other words that you can use in place of catch-22 are paradox or dilemma smart word.,English
number three is suave suave suave means to be sophisticated to be polite poised cool and.,English
well-mannered the word suave has several different origins but one very interesting  origin of the word is which means pleasant or sweet tasting example.,English
he is so poised and suave especially in front of the ladies or barack obama is so suave and polished now remember when you're at a party next time and you see this person who's so.,English
well-mannered and cultured and sophisticated.,English
don't forget to say hey who's that suave guy right out there in the corner using this word will instantly make your vocabulary.,English
very suave so smart word number four is atrocious atrocious the word atrocious means something really bad horrible terrible cruel appalling offensive atrocious has a latin root called .which means fear cruel or terrible some examples of the word atrocious are the recent rape incidents in delhi were atrocious or prisoners are treated.,English
in an atrocious manner sometimes in prisons atrocious is also used in day to day life to talk about some common wrong doing and you want to exaggerate it.,English
for example his table manners were atrocious or her dress sense is so atrocious or his grammar is atrocious.,English
so the next time you hear of a horrific act on the news remember to.,English
"remark and say that this is an atrocious act smart word number 5 is stupendous, stupendous, stupendous, means amazing astonishing.",English
now we often use the word awesome here's another word that you can use in  place of awesome stupendous for example today i got a stupendous score on my test which means i got an a very high score or.,English
i got a near-perfect score the word stupendous has classical latin roots from the word which means.,English
to be stunned so stupendous is used to describe something that is stunningly good for example she looks stupendous in that dress or what a stupendous view from this balcony or i'm reading this stupendous book that i can't put down how about you go and tell.,English
your friends that is this stupendous channel for students and some other words that you can use instead of stupendous are incredible fantastic or exceptionally good ok so before we continue with the balanced five words on this video remember to put a comment under this video.,English
to tell me which of these ten words was your favorite smart word number six is in a fix in a fix means to be in a troublesome situation for example boy i'm in a fix because i've made plans with two different friends for this evening.,English
i've lost my phone and i'm in a fix or our bus broke down this morning and i'm in a fix my friend always turns to me for help when he's in a fix and when the going is good he forgets about.,English
me so the next time you get math homework from school for example and if you've left your math book in school then you can tell your friends that you're in a real fix now you may think that the word fix has something to do with repairing something.,English
but no in a fix means to be in a troublesome situation other words that you can use instead of in a fix are i'm in a soup or i'm in a mess or i'm in a spot of bother or just i'm in a spot smart word number 7 is flummox flummox means to confuse someone.,English
so much that they forget what to do now confused tends to be an overused word so instead of that why don't you use flummox for example the boy looked completely .flummoxed when the teacher asked him a question in class or the dog was flummoxed looking at his own reflection in the mirror or the tourist was flummoxed by the different customs that.,English
he encountered during his travels or in an interview when she was asked why should we hire you she looked completely flummoxed so next time if you get confused on any questions for example in an examination then you.,English
can always say that because i hadn't prepared very well for the exam i was flummoxed by some of the questions other words that you can use instead of flummoxed are bewildered puzzled or perplexed smart word number eight is rendezvous rendezvous rendezvous.,English
is a very french way of saying meeting or date for example i have a rendezvous with my friends over lunch on saturday or i'm planning to rendezvous with my friends at the mall for movies rendezvous can be used both as a noun or as a verb for example.,English
i have a rendezvous with my friends this evening or i'm going to rendezvous with my friends tomorrow.,English
in france earlier rendezvous was used by the army to indicate a meeting place for the troops now there's something slightly exciting and secretive about the word rendezvous even now so while you can use rendezvous for any meeting.,English
in general but it won't be very appropriate for an official meeting so if you have a date perhaps you can certainly call that a rendezvous smart word number 9 is obtuse obtuse obtuse is an insult you would use it when you're trying to call someone dumb or unintelligen.t or dim-witted now you've heard the word obtuse in geometry obtuse angle and acute angle so an obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.,English
and an acute angle is this sharp angle less than 90 degrees so acute as a word is used to denote sharp and therefore also mentally sharp and obtuse is denoting blunt and .therefore also a little slow in the mind so example sentences with obtuse are the man was so obtuse that he gave away his password to a fake caller or the obtuse child.,English
wasn't able.,English
to answer a single question on the test or the obtuse man had a hard time understanding even basic instructions now suppose in your situation in daily life your boyfriend or your girlfriend is angry with you and you don't know why so you can.,English
say to them maybe i'm being obtuse but i don't know why you're so upset smart word number 10 is sluggish sluggish sluggish means to move in  slow manner to be kind of slower paced.,English
than usual to look a bit tired and lacking.,English
in energy example a heavy lunch makes me very in the afternoon sluggish has roots from the word which means a slow person and a slug is an animal that moves around really very slowly like a snail examples.,English
the economy has been very sluggish this year or the match picked up after a sluggish start.,English
or business has been sluggish this quarter you can use it in your daily life if you're feeling very tired one day you can tell your mom or you can tell.,English
your friends i'm feeling very sluggish.,English
today i could do with a energy drink other words that you can use in place of sluggish could be lethargic or dragging my feet so those were the 10 smart words and before.,English
i give you that secret tip to sound very fluent i want to remind you that in.,English
case you're looking for smart words to use on a telephone call then i'm putting a link to a video.,English
down in the description box for that and now the secret tip the secret tip to sound fluent is to use not more than one smart word or sentence i know sometimes.,English
we get very excited because.,English
we've learnt a whole lot of these smart words and we tend to stuff two three four of them in one sentence that doesn't sound natural.,English
so one at a time be sure that you're pronouncing .the word in the right manner go on to google and type the word and in the search right on top you'll see a little speaker icon click on that speaker.,English
and hear the pronunciation once or twice.,English
and you're ready to go and if you've liked this video don't forget to give us a thumbs up with a comment.,English
for me under it telling me which of these 10 words what's your favorite and also.,English
if you haven't already press the subscribe button and the bell icon right next to it and happy watching.,English
hey guys welcome to my channel in this video.,English
i'm gonna give you top 50 english phrases that you can use in your everyday life.,English
so if you are just about to embark on your journey.,English
"to an english-speaking country, you can totally use this.",English
phrases if you have been learning english for a while and you want to resume learning.,English
this is the best video to start with so let's go 50 phrases in english in hopefully 10 minutes.,English
phrase number one this is another way to ask.,English
how are you?,English
how is it going?,English
how's it going?.,English
so you meet someone and you time how is it going?.,English
phrase number two when you haven't seen somebody for a while you tell him a long time no see so that means that you haven't seen this person maybe weeks or months a long time no see phrase number.,English
three if you want to ask you what have you been doing.,English
you ask what have you been up to so what was going on in your life?.,English
what have you been up to raise them before if everything is going?,English
well you can just answer can't complain everything is really cool.,English
"can't complain next phrase somebody tells you something and you haven't really mentioned it in the conversation like they guess somehow that you have a new job, and you ask him.",English
how do you know?.,English
where did you get the news like how do you.,English
know if somebody tells a cool joke you can tell that's a good one.,English
that's a great joke so the phrase is that's a good one.,English
if you want to thank somebody you can say it's very kind of you thank you so much for doing that that's very kind of you it is very kind of you if somebody.,English
"was trying to help you, but couldn't reach the result you can say.",English
"thank you anyway it doesn't matter, but thank you anyway.",English
thank you for your effort.,English
"no thank you anyway, and another phrase that i use in my email sometimes when i haven't asked for a person.",English
i ask and then i say in the end.,English
"thank you in advance, which means that i really hope that you're gonna.",English
do it some thanking you in advance.,English
"thank you in advance if somebody made a mistake, and he's really upset about it.",English
you can just say no worries.,English
"don't worry no worries, which means don't worry about it.",English
it's fine.,English
no worries imagine you came home and there are all of your friends sitting on your couch.,English
and you're like what's going on in here like what are you doing here?.,English
what is going on if you didn't catch something or it didn't understand the person you can always ask did i get you right?.,English
and then go ahead and explain where you got did i get you right?.,English
if you ask somebody not to be upset not to cry you can say don't take it to heart.,English
don't take it to heart like seriously don't be so upset don't take it to heart.,English
another way to ask if you didn't catch a part of a phrase you can say i didn't catch the last word.,English
i'm sorry.,English
can you repeat it because i didn't catch the last word if he wants somebody to repeat the whole phrase again.,English
you can say sorry.,English
i wasn't listening because maybe you were busy.,English
"maybe you were talking on the phone and somebody was talking to you, and you're like.",English
oh my god.,English
sorry i wasn't listening.,English
can you repeat it?.,English
i'm sorry.,English
i wasn't listening another phrase that i use all the time.,English
it doesn't matter like don't worry if you drop your coffee all over me.,English
it's like it doesn't matter.,English
i'll be fine.,English
i'm going to laundry anyway.,English
it doesn't matter if you want to wish somebody luck.,English
and i always do that you can say fingers crossed and you cross the fingers like that.,English
fingers crossed.,English
another phrase that americans use is oh bad that explains it and.,English
"the situation is you didn't get something and then you get an extra effect, and you get it.",English
and you're like oh that that explains it that explains it.,English
another way to tell the person to not be upset is you can say things happen like it's okay.,English
things happen do not be upset if you don't have the name of a person you want to talk to him.,English
you can say sorry to bother you you know you see.,English
somebody's busy you can always say sorry to bother you and then you can go ahead and ask.,English
"sorry to bother you.if you are in the middle of something in somebody's asking you something you can say oh.you're in the middle of something and somebody somebody's asking you to do something you say, i'm sorry.",English
i'll be with you in a minute i'll be with you in and then you resume doing something and you say where were we.,English
like when did we stop where were we and you have to repeat it because what it's the sound that somebody some people mistake with .,English
so this is a great way to practice where were we again if you're in the middle of a conversation?,English

"AlÈm disso, a WikipÈdia deve expor o conhecimento que j‡ est‡ estabelecido e reconhecido.",Portugese

"Existem fÛruns especializados que centralizam as discuss‡µes de decis‡µes espec‡≠ficas, como por exemplo, se um artigo deve ou n„o ser eliminado.",Portugese
"A mediaÁ„o È por vezes utilizada, embora tenha sido considerada por alguns wikipedistas in˙til na resoluÁ„o de disputas particularmente controversas.",Portugese
"An‡lises estat‡≠sticas sugerem que a resoluÁ„o de disputas na WikipÈdia ignora o conte˙do das disputas de usu‡rios e centra-se, ao invÈs disso, na conduta do usu‡rio, funcionando n„o tanto para resolver disputas e promover a paz entre os usu‡rios conflitantes, mas para eliminar usu‡rios problem‡ticos enquanto os usu‡rios potencialmente produtivos voltam a participar.",Portugese
"Suas soluÁ‡µes incluem o banimento de usu‡rios da WikipÈdia (usado em 15,7% dos casos), soluÁ‡µes em relaÁ„o ao assunto (23,4%), bloqueio de artigos (43,3%) e avisos e penalidades (63,2%).",Portugese

"Ativistas de proteÁ„o ‡† crianÁa dizem que conte˙do sexual visual aparece em v‡rias p‡ginas da WikipÈdia, exibido sem qualquer aviso ou categorizaÁ„o de idade.",Portugese

"[207] O artigo sobre ""Virgin Killer"", um ‡lbum de 1976 da banda alem„ de heavy metal Scorpions, apresenta uma imagem da capa original do ‡lbum, que retrata uma menina prÈ-adolescente nua.",Portugese
A publicaÁ„o da capa original causou polÍmica e ela foi substitu‡≠da em alguns pa‡≠ses.,Portugese
"Em dezembro de 2008, o acesso ao artigo da vers„o inglesa ""Virgin Killer"" foi bloqueado durante quatro dias pela maioria dos provedores de serviÁos de internet no Reino Unido, depois que foi denunciado por um leitor como pornografia infantil.",Portugese
"[208] A Internet Watch Foundation, uma organizaÁ„o n„o governamental sem fins lucrativos, criticou a inclus„o da fotografia como ""de mau gosto"".",Portugese
"[209] Em abril de 2010 Larry Sanger escreveu uma carta para o Federal Bureau of Investigation, destacando sua preocupaÁ„o por duas categorias de imagens na WikipÈdia conterem pornografia infantil, violando a lei federal sobre obscenidade dos EUA.",Portugese
"[210] Sanger mais tarde esclareceu que as imagens, que eram relativas ‡† pedofilia e uma sobre lolicon, n„o eram fotos de crianÁas verdadeiras, mas disse que eram ""representaÁ‡µes visuais obscenas do abuso sexual de crianÁas"", nos termos do PROTECT Act de 2003.",Portugese

"Mais especificamente, o tribunal ordenou que a URL no dom‡≠nio alem„o.de (http://www.wikipedia.de/) n„o poderia redirecionar para servidores da enciclopÈdia na FlÛrida, em http://de.wikipedia.org, embora os leitores alem„es ainda permanecessem capazes de usar a URL baseada nos EUA diretamente, e n„o houve praticamente nenhuma perda de acesso por parte deles.",Portugese

"Le mot nature est un terme polysÈmique (cÄôest-‡†-dire qu'il a plusieurs sens)†: il peut signifier la composition et la matiËre d'une chose (ce qu'elle est, son essence), l'origine et le devenir d'une chose, l'ensemble du rÈel indÈpendant de la culture humaine, ou l'ensemble des systËmes et des phÈnomËnes naturels[1].",French
"Au sens commun, la nature peut regrouper†: Face au constat des rÈpercussions nÈgatives des activitÈs humaines sur l'environnement biophysique et la perte accÈlÈrÈe de naturalitÈ et de biodiversitÈ au cours des derniËres dÈcennies, la protection de la nature et des milieux naturels, la sauvegarde des habitats et des espËces, la mise en place d'un dÈveloppement durable et raisonnable et l'Èducation ‡† l'environnement sont devenues des demandes pour une grande partie des citoyens de la plupart des pays industrialisÈs.",French
"Les principes de l'Èthique environnementale, de nouvelles lois et des chartes de protection de l'environnement fondent le dÈveloppement d'une idÈologie culturelle humaine en relation avec la biosphËre.",French
"Si l'Ètymologie du terme ´†nature†ª est relativement bien connue, l'Èvolution de son sens est beaucoup plus complexe ‡† dÈterminer, et ce terme a connu des significations trËs diffÈrentes voire contradictoires pendant son histoire[1].",French
Le mot nature est attestÈ en franÁais depuis 1119[2].,French
"Il vient du latin natura, qui dÈsignait ´†le cours des choses†; le caractËre naturel, la constitution, la qualitÈ†; l'univers†ª et littÈralement ´†naissance†ª.",French
"Le terme vient lui-mÍme du verbe nascor (´†naÓtre†ª), ici au supin[1].",French
"Si ce terme signifie essentiellement le ´†caractËre innÈ†ª au IIe†siËcle avant notre Ëre, le latin classique, notamment par le biais de CicÈron, va l'enrichir de tous les sens du terme grec phusis, beaucoup plus complexe et obscur et dont il devient la traduction en philosophie latine[1].",French
"Phusis vient du verbe phuein, dÈrivÈ de la racine phu qui dÈsigne la croissance vÈgÈtale.",French
"Phuein, c'est l'Èclosion, ce qui se manifeste en rÈvÈlant ce qui Ètait contenu dans la semence†; ainsi, le phuein, c'est le propre de la plante qui croÓt ‡† partir de soi-mÍme, qui a son centre de changement ‡† l'intÈrieur et non pas ‡† l'extÈrieur, comme une pierre.",French
"Pour Merleau-Ponty, cette parentÈ de la phusis et du vÈgÈtal fait que ´†est nature ce qui a un sens, sans que ce sens ait ÈtÈ posÈ par la pensÈe.",French
C'est l'autoproduction d'un sens†ª[3].,French
"Cette Ètymologie indique que les anciens grecs et romains avaient une conception dynamique, ´†vitaliste†ª de la nature[1], conception selon laquelle le vivant n'est pas rÈductible aux lois physico-chimiques de la matiËre[4].",French
"Pour les grecs de l'antiquitÈ, Aristote en particulier, la nature est une puissance d'engendrement des Ítres, mais cette puissance n'est pas sÈparÈe des choses elles-mÍmes, elle leur est ´†immanente†ª†: ´†chaque Ítre naturel a en soi-mÍme un principe de mouvement et de repos†ª[5].",French
"Aristote ÈnumËre cependant plusieurs dÈfinitions diffÈrentes de la nature, et introduit une opposition entre le naturel et l'artificiel†: le naturel est ce qui est produit par la phusis, ce qui existe par soi-mÍme, l'artificiel est ce qui est produit par la technË, par l'action et le travail (d'Hommes, d'animaux ou de dieux).",French
C'est cette opposition qui sera plus tard reprise dans la philosophie romaine par CicÈron ‡† travers l'opposition nature/culture[1].,French
"Cette premiËre approche dynamique et vitaliste s'est estompÈe au XVIIe†siËcle o˘ le mot devient synonyme d'univers matÈriel, rÈglÈ par des lois[1].",French
"C'est ainsi que Fontenelle, aprËs Descartes, dira que ´†la nature est en grand ce qu'une montre est en petit†ª[6].",French
"Mais si cette vision mÈcaniste de la nature reste encore largement rÈpandue, elle a ÈtÈ critiquÈe par la gÈnÈration romantique au dÈbut du XIXe†siËcle, et notamment par Engels dans son Anti-D¸hring[7]†: pour lui il faut concevoir la nature, aussi bien sur terre que dans l'univers comme un processus Èvolutif, historique et dialectique†: rien dans la nature ne reste identique ‡† soi, tout change et se transforme en permanence.",French
"Cette nouvelle approche redevenue dynamique s'illustrera pendant tout le XIXe siËcle, notamment ‡† travers Darwin qui instaure, dans la foulÈe de Buffon, une approche historique de la nature, qui n'est dËs lors plus fixe†: les espËces Èvoluent en permanence, ainsi que les milieux dans lesquels elles vivent.",French
"Tandis que Darwin se concentre sur l'histoire des Ítres, celle des roches sera illustrÈe par Alfred Wegener, qui thÈorise la dÈrive des continents.",French
La premiËre grande philosophie de la nature se trouve dans l'≈ìuvre d'Aristote.,French
"Selon lui, ´†la nature ne fait rien en  vain†ª, ce qui signifie que la nature est une puissance orientÈe vers certaines  fins.",French
L'explication  scientifique consistera donc ‡† dÈcouvrir cette finalitÈ.,French
"Par exemple, si l'eau monte dans un tuyau dont on aspire l'air, c'est parce que ""la nature a horreur du vide"".",French
"Selon Jan Patocka, ´†On peut demander si cette philosophie ne nous offre pas un cas typique d'anthropomorphisme†ª[8].",French
En fait Aristote pense l'action de la nature ‡† partir du travail de l'artisan qui imprime une forme ‡† la matiËre pour arriver ‡† son but qui est de crÈer un objet.,French
La diffÈrence est que le travail de l'artisan reste extÈrieur ‡† la matiËre alors que la nature agit ‡† l'intÈrieur de la matiËre†:´†chaque Ítre naturel a en soi-mÍme un principe de mouvement et de repos†ª[9].,French
"Mais cette action de la nature est infiniment plus parfaite que celle de l'artisan et de sa ""technÈ"".´†l'homme ne peut produire d'Ítre vivant, ni d'Ítre animÈ aussi parfait que les Ítres de nature†ª[10].",French
C'est pourquoi Aristote affirme que ´†l'art imite la nature†ª[11] Cette conception finaliste de la nature a ÈtÈ contredite par la philosophie mecaniste dÈveloppÈe au XVII∞siËcle par Descartes.,French
Selon Miguel Espinoza ´†le mÈcanisme est le squelette mÈtaphysique de la science†ª[12].,French
"Dans cette philosophie, la nature n'est plus vue comme une puissance orientÈe vers la perfection et que l'homme devrait imiter, mais comme un univers matÈriel soumis ‡† des rËgles   (""les lois de la nature"").",French
"Connaissant ces rËgles, l'homme peut alors se rendre ´†comme maÓtre et possesseur de la nature†ª (Descartes).",French
"Cependant, cette conception rÈduit la nature ‡† un statut d'objet dont les Ítres humains (les sujets) pourraient disposer ‡† leur guise.",French
L'Ècologie contemporaine a montrÈ les limites de ce dualisme.,French
"Comme le dit Michel Serres nous devons modifier notre rapport ‡† la nature†: il propose dans son livre ""Le contrat naturel"" (1990) de considÈrer la nature comme ""un sujet de droit""†: ´†la nature serait ce sujet de droit avec lequel on passerait ce fameux contrat.",French
"ª[13] Dans la mÍme perspective FranÁois Flahault montre que la sÈparation de l'homme et de la nature remonte au dualisme platonicien et chrÈtien qui sÈparent l'‚me et le corps, et il propose de s'en affranchir en prenant conscience que l'homme fait intÈgralement partie de la nature.",French
"Il nous faut ´†reconnaÓtre ‡† qui et ‡† quoi nous devons la vie - et le verbe ""devoir"", ici, nous oriente vers la gratitude et le soin, nous invite ‡† cultiver des relations d'affiliation, ‡† assumer des responsabilitÈs et des devoirs -.",French
"ª [14] Dans l'usage commun et religieux, la nature a longtemps ÈtÈ prÈsentÈe dichotomiquement en Europe, comme ce qui est autour de l'Homme, qui n'est pas lui (opposÈ ‡† la culture), et qui est animÈ par des processus ou des forces qui lui Èchappent[rÈf.",French
"souhaitÈe] vu de faÁon horizontale, puis lors du Moyen ‡Çge et avec l'arrivÈe de la pensÈe industrielle, une hiÈrarchie entre l'homme et la nature s'impose, l'homme est au-dessus de la nature, jusqu'‡† arriver ‡† un stade d'opposition ‡† la nature[15].",French
"‡ prÈsent, avec les progrËs scientifiques, il est gÈnÈralement considÈrÈ comme acquis que l'espËce humaine soit parmi d'autres dans la nature.",French
"Les sciences et notamment l'Ècologie montrent que la nature (co-)Èvolue dans le temps et l'espace, selon des dynamiques complexes, incluant celles de l'Èvolution des espËces, la sÈlection naturelle, et que les forces animÈes ou dÈtournÈes par l'Ítre humain ou d'autres espËces sont devenues capables de modifier les grands processus naturels planÈtaires.",French
"Dans l'interprÈtation des philosophies animistes ou religieuses, la nature est prÈsentÈe comme manifestant l'Èquivalent d'une volontÈ autonome ou d'un sens dÈterminÈ.",French
"Ainsi, celle-ci se vengera de ce qu'on lui fait de mal, ou au contraire rendra au centuple le bien qu'on lui fait.",French
Certains actes sont considÈrÈs comme contre nature.,French
"Ces expressions laissent penser que des cultures de l'homme contemporain accordent une valeur particuliËre ‡† la Nature, d'ordre Èthique, d'ordre moral ou d'ordre naturel, qu'il s'y inclut ou non.",French
La nature est perÁue par les sens et est pensÈe de faÁon variable selon les espËces et les individus inclus[rÈf.,French
souhaitÈe].,French
"Du point de vue philosophique, la distinction se fait simplement entre la nature, la nature des espËces et la reprÈsentation de la nature humaine (Homo sapiens).",French
"Le raisonnement confine, limite et prÈcise donc par dÈfaut la capacitÈ humaine et l'envergure ‡† accorder, ‡† reconnaÓtre et ‡† considÈrer ‡† la valeur de l'exercice.",French
La reprÈsentation de la ´†nature humaine†ª correspond logiquement aux philosophies humaines existantes et aux cultures humaines possibles.,French
"La ´†philosophie de la nature†ª est un sujet d'apparence inexplorable par l'Ítre vivant, malgrÈ de multiples miroitements perceptibles.",French
"D'une certaine faÁon, on peut dire que le christianisme, suivant la tradition biblique et juda‡Øque, a dÈsacralisÈ la nature, qui fut alors associÈe ‡† celle dÄôune transcendance divine, extÈrieure ‡† l'homme[1].",French
Le mot mÍme de ´†nature†ª n'apparaÓt jamais dans la Bible[1].,French
"Dans la GenËse, la nature est prÈsentÈe dans le rÈcit de la CrÈation, comme l'≈ìuvre d'un Dieu crÈateur†: La CrÈation se poursuit tout au long de ´†six jours†ª.",French
"Le sixiËme jour, Dieu crÈe l'homme et la femme†: La nature est alors prÈsentÈe comme un accËs ‡† lÄô‡âcriture sainte.",French
"Actuellement, pour les catholiques, la nature est l'appellation la‡Øque de crÈation.",French
"Saint Augustin, reprenant la tradition philosophique grecque, voit dans les crÈatures deux types de nature†: l'essence (essentia) et la substance (substantia).",French
"Pour lui, ´†mÍme le plus ignorant lit dans le monde†ª.",French
Les clÈs d'accËs aux ‡âcritures sont alors les quatre sens de l'‡âcriture.,French
La littÈrature allÈgorique du Moyen ‡Çge faisait appel ‡† plusieurs de ces sens pour l'interprÈtation des textes.,French
"Alain de Lille (1114-1203) Ècrivit par exemple deux poËmes (Anticlaudianus et De planctu Naturae) dont le principal personnage est ´†Nature†ª, qui est une figure emblÈmatique des lois du monde crÈÈ par Dieu.",French
"Il prÈcise que ces poËmes doivent Ítre lus ‡† trois niveaux†: au sens littÈral (pour l'entendement puÈril), au sens moral, ou au sens allÈgorique[16].",French
"Une autre illustration de ces reprÈsentations de la nature se trouve dans la sÈrie des tapisseries de La Dame ‡† la licorne, qui est toute chargÈe d'allÈgories[17].",French
"LÄôidÈe sous-jacente est que la nature ne fait rien au hasard, mais est soumise ‡† un commandement divin.",French
"Le transcendantalisme, nÈ au XIXe†siËcle, suit le principe selon lequel la nature est un Ítre divin, apprenant ‡† l'homme la raison et la beautÈ[1].",French
Les transcendantalistes trouvent dans la nature une source d'expÈriences et d'aventures indispensables au dÈveloppement intellectuel et spirituel de l'Homme.,French
Cette idÈe prÈvaut jusquÄô‡† l'apparition de la conception moderne de la science (GalilÈe).,French
"Nouvelles reprÈsentations Avec GalilÈe et Descartes, une nouvelle reprÈsentation du monde apparaÓt avec une nouvelle hiÈrarchie.",French
"Descartes rejette la philosophie scolastique†: Dans sa philosophie, Descartes introduisit des rapports radicalement nouveaux entre  l'homme et la nature, divisant le monde entre ´†res extensa†ª (les choses, donc la nature, passive) et ´†res cogitans†ª (l'esprit, donc l'Homme et Dieu, actifs et pourvus d'une intentionnalitÈ)[1].",French
"Avec lÄô‚ge classique au XVIIe†siËcle, et la naissance de la science moderne, on assiste ainsi ‡† lÄôinvention d'une nouvelle reprÈsentation de la nature.",French
"Cette reprÈsentation est le rÈsultat de la croyance de beaucoup de philosophes des XVIIe et XVIIIe†siËcles, selon lesquels la nature Ètait gouvernÈe par une loi universelle, la gravitation.",French
On perÁoit une extension des limites du monde connu ‡† d'autres planËtes.,French
Le monde s'Ètend alors au systËme solaire dont on connaÓt les ´†lois†ª d'Èvolution qu'il est possible de dÈcrire sous une forme mathÈmatique.,French
La mÈthode expÈrimentale permit de faire progresser la connaissance de lÄôhistoire ´†naturelle†ª (i.e.,French
des sciences naturelles).,French
Ce qui a fait dire ‡† Maurice Merleau-Ponty ´†Ce ne sont pas les dÈcouvertes scientifiques qui ont provoquÈ le changement de lÄôidÈe de Nature.,French
CÄôest le changement de lÄôidÈe de Nature qui a permis ces dÈcouvertes†ª[19].,French
"‡âmancipation de la pensÈe L'Èpoque moderne a aussi inventÈ la libertÈ de pensÈe (cogito ergo sum, dit Descartes), il devient possible de parler publiquement d'athÈisme.",French
"LÄôintervention divine devient alors plus abstraite, confinÈe au mystËre de la foi.",French
"Ainsi, certaines formes d'empirisme ne rejettent pas la notion de foi et de religion, au contraire†: la mÈthode expÈrimentale du physicien et chimiste irlandais Robert Boyle, par exemple, s'appuie sur une foi vÈcue dans l'expÈrimentation scientifique.",French
"Descartes rejette la conception aristotÈlicienne de la nature, l'existence de Dieu Ètant perÁue sur un plan purement mÈtaphysique.",French
"Une nouvelle conception de lÄôhomme apparut au XVIIIe†siËcle, un homme qui s'appuie davantage sur la raison et sur l'expÈrience pour comprendre le monde.",French
"Au XIXe†siËcle, la notion mÍme de mÈtaphysique s'estompe presque complËtement, submergÈe par les idÈologies.",French
"Spinoza reviendra sur les propos de Descartes qu'il rÈcuse notamment ‡† travers son expression Deus sive Natura (´†Dieu, c'est-‡†-dire la Nature†ª).",French
"Spinoza, dans Le TraitÈ thÈologico-politique et l'‡âthique identifie Dieu ‡† une Nature ´†nÈcessaire†ª, divinitÈ infinie et immanente qui fait un avec la nature.",French
La substance universelle se compose ainsi aussi bien du corps que de l'esprit.,French
"La conception de l'homme, dÈveloppÈe par Descartes, est tardive en Occident, mais Ègalement inÈdite dans lÄôhistoire du monde.",French
Les sciences humaines nÄôhÈritent pas dÄôun domaine vacant car lÄô´†homme nÄôexistait pas†ª.,French
Mais cette Èmancipation partielle de l'humanitÈ n'a pas pour autant supprimÈ toute forme de croyance.,French
"Pendant les LumiËres, alors que les pratiques religieuses sont souvent perÁues comme des superstitions par les philosophes, la conception populaire d'une sacralisation de la nature prit une emphase toute particuliËre.",French
"Ainsi, la croyance en un dieu crÈateur est trËs prÈsente ‡† travers le dÈisme†: Voltaire ne croyait-il pas en un dieu crÈateur, qui aurait abandonnÈ l'humanitÈ ‡† son triste destin†?",French
Cette croyance poussÈe ‡† l'extrÍme engendra le culte de la Raison et de l'‡ätre suprÍme.,French
"Il est significatif de constater que dans ce contexte de dÈchristianisation, parmi les fÍtes civiques, c'est la fÍte de la nature qui aura rÈellement du succËs.",French
‡âvolutions sÈmantiques et esthÈtiques Ce changement de reprÈsentation se fit ‡† la faveur d'un changement linguistique majeur†: l'apparition du franÁais classique[20].,French
"Ainsi, le mot physique, qui Ètymologiquement, en grec, signifie la nature dans son ensemble (phusika), changea de sens pour prendre un sens presque exclusivement scientifique.",French
Un autre corollaire fut une Èvolution de la sensibilitÈ esthÈtique.,French
"La hiÈrarchie des genres de la peinture classique, par exemple, accordait peu d'importance au paysage.",French
Celui-ci occupa ‡† partir du XIXe†siËcle une place beaucoup plus importante.,French
La conception cartÈsienne de la nature n'a pas pour autant supprimÈ le sens que donnent les naturalistes ‡† ce mot.,French
"L'histoire des sciences naturelles montre que l'interaction des Ítres vivants entre eux et avec leur milieu a ÈtÈ une prÈoccupation constante de beaucoup de scientifiques, qui a pris une importance croissante jusqu'‡† l'avËnement d'une Ècologie plus holistique, dont la naissance peut se situer vers le XVIIIe†siËcle.",French
"Elle illustre la diversitÈ des thËmes ÈtudiÈs en Ècologie, et de faÁon plus gÈnÈrale dans les sciences naturelles.",French
"Une Ètude de 2020[1] suggËre qu'il existe actuellement quatre sens principaux au terme ´†nature†ª, irrÈductibles les uns aux autres†: La notion de nature porte donc en elle des questions philosophiques, ‡† travers les rapports que l'homme entretient avec le milieu naturel et l'environnement, ses conceptions de la vie sociale, et les multiples sens qu'il est possible d'attribuer au mot nature dans les reprÈsentations sociales.",French
Le mot nature a donc conservÈ des sens multiples (polysÈmie).,French
"Les prÈoccupations environnementales actuelles montrent combien il importe d'identifier ces sens et leurs finalitÈs dans chaque contexte particulier†: suivant la dÈfinition utilisÈe, le rapport de l'HumanitÈ ‡† la ´†nature†ª n'est pas le mÍme, et l'idÈe de ´†conservation de la nature†ª change d'objet, d'objectifs et de mÈthodes[1].",French
La nature recouvre les rÈalitÈs suivantes†: La Terre est la seule planËte connue pour abriter la vie et ses caractÈristiques naturelles font l'objet de nombreuses recherches scientifiques.,French
"Au sein du SystËme solaire, c'est la troisiËme la plus proche du Soleil†; c'est la plus grande planËte tellurique et la cinquiËme plus grande de toutes.",French
"Ses principales caractÈristiques climatiques sont la prÈsence de deux grandes rÈgions polaires, deux zones tempÈrÈes relativement Ètroites et une vaste rÈgion Èquatoriale tropicale ‡† subtropicale[21][rÈf.",French

"Les prÈcipitations varient considÈrablement selon l'endroit, de plusieurs mËtres d'eau par annÈe ‡† moins d'un millimËtre[rÈf.",French

71†% de la surface de la Terre est recouverte d'ocÈans d'eau salÈe.,French
Le reste est constituÈ de continents et d'Óles[rÈf.,French

La Terre a ÈvoluÈ gr‚ce ‡† des processus gÈologiques et biologiques qui ont laissÈ des traces des conditions originales.,French
La surface extÈrieure est divisÈe en plusieurs plaques tectoniques qui migrent progressivement.,French
"L'intÈrieur reste actif, avec une Èpaisse couche de manteau en convection et un noyau rempli de fer qui gÈnËre un champ magnÈtique.",French
Ce noyau de fer est composÈ d'une phase interne solide et d'une phase externe fluide.,French
"Le mouvement de convection dans le noyau gÈnËre des courants Èlectriques par dynamo qui, ‡† leur tour, gÈnËrent le champ gÈomagnÈtique[rÈf.",French

"Les conditions atmosphÈriques ont ÈtÈ considÈrablement modifiÈes par rapport aux conditions d'origine par la prÈsence de formes de vie[22], ce qui crÈe un Èquilibre Ècologique qui stabilise les conditions de surface.",French
"MalgrÈ les grandes variations rÈgionales du climat selon la latitude et d'autres facteurs gÈographiques, le climat mondial moyen ‡† long terme est assez stable pendant les pÈriodes interglaciaires[23], et les variations d'un degrÈ ou deux de la tempÈrature moyenne mondiale ont eu historiquement des effets majeurs sur l'Èquilibre Ècologique et sur la gÈographie de la Terre[24],[25].",French
Voir†: Le caractËre imprÈcis de la dÈfinition mÍme de ´†Nature†ª entretient une ambigu‡ØtÈ dans la relation entre Hommes et Nature[1].,French
"La biosphËre terrestre Ètant de plus en plus marquÈe par l'empreinte de l'Homme, il devient de plus en plus difficile d'y trouver des espaces purement ´†naturels†ª au sens de ´†dÈpourvus d'influence humaine†ª.",French
"La nature au sens le plus strict est refoulÈe d'une part vers le bas, dans le sous-sol lointain et les grands fonds ocÈaniques, et d'autre part vers le haut, dans l'espace intersidÈral.",French
Les phÈnomËnes climatiques eux-mÍmes ne sont plus considÈrÈs comme indÈpendants de l'activitÈ humaine.,French
"D'un autre cÙtÈ, le concept est souvent employÈ dans un sens dÈrivÈ pour dÈsigner des espaces amÈnagÈs par l'homme mais dans lesquels une large place est rÈservÈe ‡† des peuplements vÈgÈtaux et animaux†; c'est ainsi qu'on peut parler de nature ‡† propos d'une forÍt, mÍme si elle est cultivÈe et exploitÈe depuis des siËcles, et qu'on qualifie mÍme de parcs naturels des territoires o˘ s'exercent des activitÈs agricoles intensives dotÈes de moyens mÈcaniques et chimiques modernes.",French
"Dans ce cas, le qualificatif naturel dÈsigne certaines caractÈristiques paysagËres (variables selon le lieu et sans dÈfinition universelle) et n'implique pas l'absence d'artifice humain.",French
"Il fait rÈfÈrence ‡† un mode de gestion de l'espace par l'Homme, plutÙt qu'‡† une absence d'intervention humaine.",French
"Le mot naturel a Ègalement ÈtÈ employÈ ‡† l'Èpoque coloniale dans un sens Èquivalent ‡† celui du mot anglais native, c'est-‡†-dire au sens Ètymologique, pour dÈsigner les habitants natifs des pays colonisÈs.",French
"Cette appellation, qui ne se voulait pas injurieuse, avait cependant une connotation raciste dans la mesure o˘ elle suggÈrait que ces hommes vivaient dans des conditions plus ´†proches de la nature†ª que les autres.",French
"Dans le mÍme ordre d'idÈes, l'imagination populaire reprÈsente souvent les hommes de la PrÈhistoire comme plus naturels que les hommes d'aujourd'hui, suggÈrant que la nature correspond ‡† un Ètat primitif dont le progrËs amËne inÈluctablement ‡† s'Èloigner.",French
L'idÈe de nature a ÈtÈ remaniÈe par la culture urbaine ‡† travers la notion mythique de sauvagerie dÈsignant de maniËre gÈnÈrale ce qui est extÈrieur ‡† la civilisation.,French
Le fait que le mÍme mot sauvage soit utilisÈ d'une part comme un synonyme de naturel et d'autre part pour qualifier des actes particuliËrement violents ou cruels (mÍme s'ils sont commis dans des sociÈtÈs urbaines avec des moyens techniques sophistiquÈs) met bien en Èvidence une certaine tradition idÈologique qui place plus ou moins consciemment du cÙtÈ de la nature ce qui est Ètranger ‡† la culture dominante et/ou mauvais.,French
"Paradoxalement, il se trouve aussi que, dans d'autres contextes, le mot naturel est employÈ dans la langue populaire comme un synonyme de normal, lÈgitime ou logique†; la Nature, lieu de la sauvagerie, est donc aussi celui du bon sens fondamental et, par voie de consÈquence, elle est la source des principes les plus lÈgitimes de l'Homme civilisÈ.",French
"Le dÈveloppement des sciences et des techniques au cours des deux derniers siËcles a ÈtÈ, de son cÙtÈ, largement accompagnÈ par une idÈologie d'opposition entre l'Homme et la Nature, la connaissance Ètant gÈnÈralement perÁue comme un instrument de domination de la Nature plutÙt que comme un moyen de vivre en harmonie avec elle.",French
"Cette Èpoque a vu aussi se dÈvelopper la philosophie du droit naturel, dont dÈcoulent notamment les droits de l'homme et selon laquelle l'Homme se verrait attribuer par nature des prÈrogatives immuables†; mais ici le paradoxe n'est qu'apparent, car dans ce contexte la notion de nature est employÈe dans le sens de nature humaine, et n'implique aucune espËce de ´†rÈconciliation†ª avec la Nature (la promotion des droits de l'homme est d'ailleurs, jusqu'‡† prÈsent, indÈpendante de toute prÈoccupation environnementale)[26].",French
"En fait, la distinction entre l'humain et le naturel repose essentiellement sur des notions historiques et subjectives, voire contradictoires.",French
La question de son bien-fondÈ universel reste ouverte.,French
"La distinction (parfois conÁue comme une opposition) a ÈtÈ inspirÈe et justifiÈe par le besoin, d'origine religieuse ou dÈcoulant de certaines formes d'humanisme, de reprÈsenter l'Homme comme un Ítre en-dehors ou au-dessus de la Nature mÍme si par ailleurs l'Homme n'est pas sÈparable de son environnement naturel avec lequel il est en interaction permanente et dont il ne peut pas plus s'affranchir que n'importe quelle autre espËce vivante[1].",French
"Voir les thËmes suivants†: La forÍt, stratÈgiquement importante pour la fourniture du bois, a fait l'objet d'une protection fonciËre particuliËre, renforcÈe en France depuis Colbert au XVIIe siËcle.",French
"RÈcemment, le gÈnome des espËces sauvages ou domestiques a pris une valeur juridique particuliËre avec une privatisation permise par ´†marques†ª de propriÈtÈ d'hybrides et variÈtÈs vÈgÈtales ´†crÈÈes ª (ou isolÈes) par les semenciers puis les premiËres autorisations de brevetage du vivant.",French
"Mais la faune, la flore, la fonge et les organismes vivant sont encore en France et dans de nombreux pays considÈrÈ par le lÈgislateur comme res nullius (chose sans propriÈtaire).",French
"Depuis peu, et au niveau international, ils tendent cependant ‡† Ítre identifiÈs comme une partie du bien commun, qu'est la biodiversitÈ, source de services ÈcosystÈmiques†; ce qui donne une ´†valeur†ª nouvelle ‡† la nature, notamment marquÈe en Europe par les directives Habitat ou Oiseaux.",French
"La ´†Nature†ª a rÈcemment dans plusieurs pays, dont en France acquis un droit de protection, puis de reprÈsentation, assimilable dans une certaine mesure et dans certains cas ‡† celui des droits des ´†victimes†ª.",French
"Ainsi, les amÈnageurs doivent prospectivement appliquer le principe ´†Èviter > rÈduire > compenser†ª les impacts Ècologiques lors des grands projets[27].",French
"Et, en cas de pollution ou de catastrophe, le pollueur doit maintenant prendre en charge des compensations et/ou rÈparations.",French
"ThÈoriquement, cela se fait selon le principe pollueur-payeur, qui reste cependant difficile ‡† appliquer quand la pollution est ancienne ou diffuse.",French
"Le principe de ´†prÈjudice Ècologique†ª a ÈtÈ en France, en 2012, confirmÈ par la Cour de Cassation lors du procËs de l'Erika.",French
"La notion de nature renvoie a priori ‡† lÄôidÈe dÄôun domaine ayant ses propres principes de dÈveloppement, qui serait hors de lÄôaction de lÄôhomme.",French
"Or, on rÈalise aujourd'hui que le changement climatique a une origine anthropique.",French
LÄôidÈe de nature nÄôest donc pas suffisante.,French
Il y a une complÈmentaritÈ et une interaction entre la nature et les communautÈs humaines.,French
LÄôesquisse de cette complÈmentaritÈ rÈciproque peut s'Èclairer avec la notion de culture Ècologique.,French
"On constate par exemple que les notions de patrimoine naturel et de patrimoine culturel sont intimement liÈes, en observant le patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO qui dresse une liste de sites naturels et culturels.",French
"La convention de 2007 de l'UNESCO souligne l'interaction des communautÈs humaines avec la nature, dans la dÈfinition qui a ÈtÈ donnÈe du patrimoine culturel immatÈriel†: Voir aussi†: Culture et nature La notion de culture recouvre deux sens†: Le premier correspond ‡† lÄôidÈe de civilisation.",French
"Cette idÈe est aussi ancienne que l'histoire de l'humanitÈ, mais a trouvÈ une nouvelle signification avec la Philosophie des LumiËres.",French
"Dans ce sens, la culture est le trait distinctif de lÄôespËce humaine, associÈ ‡† ses savoirs et savoir-faire.",French
Cette conception franÁaise de la culture serait plutÙt individualiste.,French
"Le second est le sens allemand, Èmergeant sous lÄôinfluence du romantisme.",French
"La culture est la configuration particuliËre de croyances coutumiËres, traits matÈriels, organisations socialesÄ¶ elle est une totalitÈ singuliËre, une sphËre autonome incommensurables avec dÄôautres totalitÈs.",French
Cette conception plus collective s'oppose ‡† la conception franÁaise.,French
"Dans Les Mots et les Choses, Michel Foucault dÈfinit lÄôanthropologie comme lÄôÈtude des rapports entre la nature et la culture.",French
Globalement on peut apprÈhender cette question en distinguant les anthropologies matÈrialistes et les anthropologies symbolistes.,French
Les anthropologies matÈrialistes sÄôintÈressent aux fonctions structurantes de la vie matÈrielle.,French
"LÄôidÈe sous-jacente est que la nature est un dÈterminant de base†: elle y est dÈfinie en termes ethnocentrique, comme Ètant le moteur de la vie sociale.",French
"On y trouve lÄôanthropologie marxiste des annÈes 1970 en France, pour laquelle la nature est une donnÈe brute qui peut Ítre appropriÈe ou transformÈe, et lÄôenvironnement naturel est une prÈcondition de lÄôenvironnement Èconomique.",French
"On trouve aussi la sociobiologie et lÄôÈcologie culturelle, entre lesquelles on souligne un certain parallËle puisque pour les deux, la cause ultime des comportements revient au champ de la nature.",French
"Dans tous les cas, pour les anthropologies matÈrialistes, la culture est une forme particuliËre dÄôadaptation ‡† une nature qui serait partout un ÈlÈment dÈterminant et conditionnant.",French
Les anthropologies symbolistes sÄôintÈressent aux caractËres symboliques de la vie sociale.,French
Elles mettent lÄôaccent sur les aptitudes des hommes ‡† crÈer un monde de signification et dÄôintentionnalitÈs dÈpendant des dÈterminations brutes de la nature.,French
"Dans Anthropologie Structurale 2, LÈvi-Strauss dit que lÄôanthropologie est la discipline qui pense la relation entre la nature et la culture.",French
"La dichotomie nature / culture soulevÈe, lÄôopposition nature / culture suggËre deux possibilitÈs.",French
Soit la culture est ce qui donne un sens ‡† nature (la culture impose sa signification ‡† la nature).,French
Soit la nature dÈtermine les rapports sociaux (la nature donne forme ‡† la culture).,French
La dichotomie nature / culture utilisÈe comme outil analytique est en partie dÈrivÈe de Claude LÈvi-Strauss.,French
Il lÄôa notamment utilisÈe comme opÈrateur central pour dÈcoder les mythologies.,French
Celui-ci a ÈtÈ reconnu pertinent par les ethnologues de ces sociÈtÈs amÈrindiennes.,French
"La mythologie retrace la construction de la nature sur un fond initial dÄôindiffÈrenciation culturelle (ainsi, dans les mythes amÈrindiens, au dÈbut les animaux et les hommes avaient la mÍme apparence).",French
"Chez LÈvi-Strauss, lÄôopposition, l‡† o˘ elle est pertinente, cÄôest-‡†-dire dans les mythes, nÄôest quÄôune faÁon de mettre une Ètiquette sur des contrastes.",French
LÄôÈcologie culturelle donne un crÈdit illimitÈ ‡† la nature.,French
"LÄôanthropologie structurale, ‡† ce propos, nÄôoppose pas une forme dÄôidÈalisme mais aussi un naturalisme, mais un naturalisme de principe.",French
"LÈvi-Strauss nÄôa jamais variÈ dans lÄôidÈe que la nature conditionne les opÈrations intellectuelles, la nature devenant donc une construction empirique.",French
LÄôÈtude naturaliste doit permettre de comprendre la structure des groupes culturels.,French
Ce qui intÈresse LÈvi-Strauss est de rendre compte de la maniËre dont lÄôesprit opËre dans des contextes culturels et gÈographiques distincts (ex†: les Mythologiques).,French
"La mythologie rÈvËle dans une forme ÈpurÈe les opÈrations dÄôun esprit qui nÄôest plus condamnÈ ‡† mettre en ordre, mais qui peut ´†jouer†ª avec les rËgles de fonctionnement de la pensÈe.",French
"La dichotomie nature / culture est une spÈcificitÈ culturelle occidentale dÈveloppÈe en Europe ‡† partir de la Renaissance puis en Occident moderne de Descartes ‡† Darwin, qui sÄôest rÈpandue dans le monde entier, en mÍme temps que sÄôaccroissait lÄôinfluence politique, culturelle et commerciale de lÄôOccident (Grandes dÈcouvertes, colonisation, science occidentale), mais qui n'est pas partagÈe universellement[1],[28].",French
"Ce paradigme nÄôest pas simplement un outil analytique parmi dÄôautres, il est aussi la clef de vo˚te de lÄôÈpistÈmologie moderne.",French
"Ainsi, Philippe Descola dans Par-del‡† nature et culture (2005) distingue quatre ´†modes dÄôidentification†ª qui sont le totÈmisme, lÄôanimisme, l'analogisme et le naturalisme.",French
"Selon lui, seule la sociÈtÈ naturaliste (occidentale) produit cette frontiËre entre soi et autrui ‡† travers lÄôidÈe de ´†nature†ª dans le sens de ´†ce qui ne relËve pas de la culture†ª, ce qui ne relËve pas des traits distinctifs de lÄôespËce humaine, et des savoirs et savoir-faire humains (une des quatre dÈfinitions ÈnumÈrÈes plus haut)[1].",French
Son usage comme outil analytique en ethnologie a parfois ÈtÈ fÈcond.,French
"Toutefois, et Descola lÄôa montrÈ dans Par-del‡† nature et culture, lÄôidÈe de nature est ÈtrangËre ‡† de nombreuses sociÈtÈs.",French

La constante surveillance des modifications est Ègalement ouverte ‡† tous ‡† travers le systËme wiki.,French
"Il n'y a aucun systËme hiÈrarchique de validation†; aussi l'encyclopÈdie est-elle l'objet de nombreuses incomprÈhensions et critiques quant ‡† la qualitÈ et ‡† la fiabilitÈ de son contenu[23], et l'objet d'Ètudes sur la fiabilitÈ de WikipÈdia en anglais, la langue la plus dÈveloppÈe.",French

"La neutralitÈ de point de vue n'implique pas cependant une reprÈsentation Ègalitaire de toutes les opinions, WikipÈdia accordant plus de place aux opinions les plus largement acceptÈes.",French
"Par ses objectifs et son fonctionnement, le projet WikipÈdia s'inscrit dans une sÈrie de filiations culturelles[2]†: En revanche, WikipÈdia est assez ÈloignÈe de l'EncyclopÈdie ou Dictionnaire raisonnÈ des sciences, des arts et des mÈtiers par sa volontÈ de prÈsenter des informations neutres, alors que l'ouvrage conÁu par Denis Diderot et Jean Le Rond d'Alembert se caractÈrisait au contraire par son fort engagement contre l'obscurantisme[32].",French
"L'historien du livre Roger Chartier souligne cependant que WikipÈdia ´†repose sur les contributions multiples d'une sorte de sociÈtÈ de gens de lettres invisibles†ª tout en observant que ´†Diderot n'aurait s˚rement pas acceptÈ la simple juxtaposition des articles, sans arbre des connaissances ni ordre raisonnÈ, qui [la] caractÈrise†ª[33].",French

"Selon Le Figaro, le cofondateur de WikipÈdia, Jimmy Wales, affirme ainsi qu'´†en gÈnÈral, la correction d'une erreur ou d'une information fallacieuse a lieu en quelques heures, voire en quelques minutes†ª[63].",French
"Une Ètude de l'universitÈ du Minnesota affirme que, jusqu'en 2006, sur deux millions de modifications problÈmatiques, 42†% ont ÈtÈ rÈparÈes dans un temps qui rend peu probable leur lecture par un visiteur, alors qu'environ 11†% des vandalismes dÈtectÈs persistaient aprËs avoir ÈtÈ vus cent fois.",French

Ce premier niveau de contrÙle porte essentiellement sur la forme.,French
"Les surveillants volontaires peuvent Ègalement corriger des problËmes Èvidents d'orthographe ou de style, et Èventuellement effectuer un contrÙle de cohÈrence rapide sur un ajout particuliËrement suspect.",French
"En 2006, 60†% des ´†vandalismes†ª Ètaient dÈtectÈs facilement par des humains (modifications dÈnuÈes de sens, offensantes ou encore suppressions massives), mais certaines catÈgories de modifications semblaient plus dÈlicates ‡† repÈrer†: dÈsinformation, suppression partielle, spam et autres[64].",French
"Le deuxiËme niveau de contrÙle consiste, pour un rÈdacteur inscrit, ‡† examiner sur sa ´†liste de suivi†ª (liste des pages qu'il a marquÈes pour les surveiller) les modifications apportÈes rÈcemment.",French
"Cet examen permet de dÈtecter et corriger assez rapidement les principaux problËmes de fond†: erreurs manifestes, ajouts hors sujet, ou manque d'objectivitÈ ou de neutralitÈ dans la formulation.",French
"Les coauteurs de l'article peuvent ainsi contrÙler de maniËre plus approfondie les ajouts suspects, si nÈcessaire en s'appuyant sur des sources de rÈfÈrence.",French
"Quand ces deux premiers niveaux de contrÙle conduisent ‡† des corrections, le correcteur volontaire peut examiner ensuite l'ensemble des ajouts effectuÈs par le mÍme contributeur, ce qui peut lui permettre de rattraper des modifications ayant ÈchappÈ aux deux premiers niveaux de contrÙle.",French

"Ces erreurs peuvent rester des mois voire des annÈes dans l'article, et restent d'autant plus longtemps que l'article est peu lu et peu modifiÈ[63].",French
Elles peuvent Ítre corrigÈes spontanÈment par un lecteur.,French
"De plus, ‡† la faveur d'une nouvelle modification, l'article repasse par les contrÙles prÈcÈdents, et les correcteurs volontaires peuvent dÈcider ‡† cette occasion de le relire en intÈgralitÈ pour corriger d'Èventuelles erreurs anciennes.",French

L'audience grandissante de WikipÈdia a conduit un grand nombre de personnes ‡† formuler des avis critiques sur la fiabilitÈ des informations prÈsentÈes dans cette encyclopÈdie.,French
"Ces critiques Ètant rÈcurrentes, une page spÈciale de WikipÈdia est consacrÈe aux rÈponses de participants ‡† WikipÈdia aux objections les plus frÈquentes[ac].",French
"Les principales critiques portent sur†: Les critiques de WikipÈdia l'accusent d'incohÈrences, de partialitÈ systÈmique et d'une forme d'anti-Èlitisme[68], et d'avoir une politique favorisant trop le consensus dans son processus Èditorial[69].",French
La fiabilitÈ et la prÈcision de WikipÈdia sont aussi des questions dÈbattues[70].,French
"D'autres critiques portent essentiellement sur sa sensibilitÈ au vandalisme et ‡† l'ajout de fausses informations[71], bien que des travaux aient suggÈrÈ que le vandalisme est gÈnÈralement de courte durÈe[72],[64].",French
D'autres critiques se rÈvËlent plutÙt positives.,French
"Ainsi, en juin 2009, le philosophe franÁais Bernard Stiegler estime que WikipÈdia, ´†passage obligÈ pour tout utilisateur d'Internet†ª, est un ´†exemple frappant d'Èconomie de la contribution†ª et que l'encyclopÈdie ´†a conÁu un systËme d'intelligence collective en rÈseau†ª[73].",French
"Des Ètudes ont ÈtÈ menÈes sur la qualitÈ du contenu proposÈe par WikipÈdia, et des comparaisons effectuÈes avec d'autres encyclopÈdies.",French
"Ces Èvaluations fournissent gÈnÈralement des conclusions positives pour WikipÈdia, mais ces rÈsultats font aussi l'objet de critiques[74].",French
"Le traitement inÈgalitaire des hommes et des femmes tant en nombre d'articles qu'en qualitÈ et neutralitÈ du contenu, avec une prÈsentation des femmes plus pÈjorative, fait l'objet d'analyses convergentes[75],[76],[77],[78].",French
"Toutefois, les Ètudes ne concluent pas sur le fait de savoir si ce biais provient des contributeurs eux-mÍmes, ou des sources qui leur sont disponibles[75].",French
"En 2017, la journÈe internationale des droits des femmes du 8 mars a vu de nombreuses initiatives pour amÈliorer le nombre d'articles consacrÈs ‡† des personnalitÈs fÈminines[79],[80],[81],[82].",French
"En octobre 2018, lors de l'attribution du Nobel de physique ‡† Donna Strickland, son absence de WikipÈdia fait rÈagir et suscite certaines critiques sur la reprÈsentativitÈ des femmes dans l'encyclopÈdie, tout en pointant du doigt la responsabilitÈ des mÈdias et universitaires qui n'avaient pas prÈalablement donnÈ de couverture ´†significative et durable†ª ‡† cette chercheuse[83].",French
Une critique souvent formulÈe par la communautÈ transgenre est la transphobie de la communautÈ anglophone de WikipÈdia[84].,French
"Le refus de l'utilisation de sources primaires peut notamment mener ‡† utiliser les deadnames ou ‡† ne pas respecter l'identitÈ de genre d'une personne, ce qui relËve de la transphobie[85],[86].",French
La version de Wikipedia en anglais dispose de conventions de style ‡† propos de l'identitÈ de genre qui prÈconisent que l'article doit utiliser l'identitÈ de genre exprimÈe par le sujet de l'article (dans la source la plus rÈcente)[86].,French
"Toutefois, il est ‡† souligner que le magazine Marianne rappelle qu'en quelques heures, ""Ellen"" a ÈtÈ remplacÈ par ""Elliot"" dans les titres d'articles, sur la fiche wikipÈdia de Elliot Page[87].",French
La Wikimedia Foundation a fait part de son inquiÈtude quant au dÈpart de personnes contribuant ‡† WikipÈdia en raison de harcËlement liÈ ‡† leur identitÈ de genre[86].,French
"Par consÈquent, Wikipedia adopte un code de conduite pour lutter contre le harcËlement suite aux problËmes comportementaux de certains de ses Èditeurs qui aux fils de discussion tournent au pugilat voire au harcËlement par un membre de la communautÈ ‡† lÄôencontre dÄôautres, notamment ‡† lÄôencontre des femmes, des personnes de la communautÈ LGBT, etc.",French

Nature (Engels voor 'natuur') is een Brits vooral natuurwetenschappelijk tijdschrift.,Dutch
Het staat als gerenommeerd bekend.,Dutch
Het verscheen voor het eerst op 4 november 1869[1] en werd opgericht door de amateur-astronoom Norman Lockyer.,Dutch
Het groeide uit van een eenvoudige publicatie voor amateur-wetenschappers tot een van de meest gerenommeerde wetenschappelijke tijdschriften.,Dutch
Een publicatie in Nature wordt door wetenschappers zeer hoog aangeslagen.,Dutch
"Er zijn geen tijdschriften met een hogere impactfactor, behalve misschien Science, dat met Nature om de toppositie concurreert.",Dutch
De impactfactor van Nature schommelt rond de 40.[bron?],Dutch
"Hoewel Nature een lichte nadruk op biologie legt, accepteert het artikelen uit allerlei wetenschappelijke vakgebieden.",Dutch
"Er zijn inmiddels diverse speciale edities die zich met aparte vakgebieden bezighouden: Verder bestaan er nog enkele edities van Nature Reviews, waarin hoogkwalitatieve overzichtsartikelen verschijnen.",Dutch

"Wikipedia wordt gepubliceerd onder een vrije licentie, waardoor de inhoud elders opnieuw te gebruiken is.",Dutch
De website is eigendom van de Wikimedia Foundation; het is het oudste en bekendste project van deze organisatie.,Dutch
"Wikipedia is opgezet in de vorm van een wiki, hetgeen betekent dat elke inhoudelijke pagina door iedere bezoeker bewerkt kan worden.",Dutch
Voor Wikipedia is een apart programma ontworpen.,Dutch
"De software, MediaWiki, is opensourcesoftware die ook gebruikt wordt door de andere projecten van de Wikimedia Foundation en door talloze andere projecten en bedrijven.",Dutch
"Op Wikipedia gelden vijf principes, zuilen genoemd:[2] Naast deze drie zuilen gelden twee interne zuilen: De naam Wikipedia is een samentrekking van wiki, dat in het Hawaiiaans snel betekent, en het Engelse woord encyclopedia.",Dutch
"Wikipedia was de eerste serieuze, algemene, digitale encyclopedie waarbij met het wiki-concept gewerkt werd.",Dutch
"In vergelijking met andere concepten om informatie te verzamelen heeft dit tot gevolg dat Wikipedia, daar waar het actuele informatie betreft, in het algemeen snel bijgewerkt is.",Dutch
Daar verwijst het eerder genoemde woord wiki ook naar.,Dutch
Kenmerkend voor het project en het succes ervan is tevens het feit dat de inhoud onder een vrije licentie valt.,Dutch
Alle tekst en media worden door Wikipedia door middel van de GFDL- (en sinds 2008) CC-BY-SA-licentie vrijgegeven en beschikbaar gesteld voor het publiek.,Dutch
"Iedere auteur blijft eigenaar van zijn bijdrage, maar anderen kunnen voortbouwen op individuele bijdragen.",Dutch
De vrijgave van bijdragen onder de CC-BY-SA-licentie is definitief en kan niet ingetrokken worden.,Dutch
"Eenieder is daarmee gerechtigd de inhoud kosteloos te verspreiden en/of te wijzigen, terwijl niemand de toegang tot een uit Wikipedia overgenomen en eventueel gewijzigde inhoud kan worden onthouden.",Dutch
"Wikipedia presenteert zich daarbij uitdrukkelijk als een encyclopedie en niet als bijvoorbeeld een woordenboek, discussieforum of webportaal.",Dutch
Voor lexicografische informatie is het zusterproject Wiktionary (in het Nederlands WikiWoordenboek) in het leven geroepen.,Dutch
Voor mobiele apparaten zijn ook speciale apps beschikbaar.,Dutch
Over de documentering van de menselijke kennis wordt al vele jaren nagedacht.,Dutch
"Onder andere de bibliograaf Paul Otlet, bedenker van de Universele Decimale Classificatie (UDC), wijdde zijn leven aan de vraag hoe gegevens en kennis toegankelijk gemaakt kunnen worden in een Universeel Boek of een vernuftig kaartsysteem met behulp van een machinaal systeem.",Dutch
"[3] Later streefde Herbert George Wells naar een World Brain,[4] een samenvatting van alle kennis op microfilm.",Dutch
Ook Vannevar Bush dacht dat de toekomst van volledige documentatie lag in een systeem met microfilm: Memex.,Dutch
[5] In 1960 begon Ted Nelson met zijn Project Xanadu dat gebruikmaakte van hypertekst.,Dutch
De Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia van Philips' CDI (1992) en Encarta (1993) van Microsoft waren de eerste encyclopedie‡´n op cd-rom die gebruikmaakten van hyperlinks.,Dutch
"Wikipedia is een modern antwoord en maakt gebruik van de nieuwe mogelijkheden van www, internet en software voor samenwerking.",Dutch
"Wikipedia werd in 2001 opgericht door de Amerikaanse ondernemer Jimmy Wales, samen met zijn medewerker Larry Sanger.",Dutch
"In 2003 droeg Wales zijn rechten op de naam Wikipedia, de website zelf en de servers waarop deze draaide over aan de Wikimedia Foundation, een stichting die hij oprichtte om het behoud en de verdere ontwikkeling van Wikipedia langdurig mogelijk te maken.",Dutch
De stichting leeft bijna uitsluitend van donaties en had anno 2017 in de Verenigde Staten ongeveer 280 betaalde medewerkers.,Dutch
Wikipedia zelf wordt echter door vrijwilligers beheerd en geschreven.,Dutch
"Het project Wikipedia begon met een conversatie tussen twee internetvrienden, Larry Sanger, hoofdredacteur van Nupedia en Ben Kovitz, een computerprogrammeur en bËta-wetenschapper, op de avond van 3 januari 2001 in San Diego (Californi‡´).",Dutch
Kovitz had al eerder te maken gehad met een ander soort wikiproject.,Dutch
"Toen hij het basisconcept aan Sanger uitlegde, zag deze onmiddellijk dat het wikiformat geschikt zou zijn voor het opzetten van een opener, minder formeel project dan Nupedia.",Dutch
"Vier maanden daarvoor hadden Sanger en zijn baas Jimmy Wales, president-directeur van Bomis, Inc., al eens verschillende mogelijkheden besproken om naast Nupedia een opener, aanvullend project te beginnen.",Dutch
Het kostte Sanger dus niet veel moeite om Wales over te halen een wiki voor Nupedia op te zetten.,Dutch
Nupedia's eerste wiki ging online op 10 januari 2001.,Dutch
"Van de kant van de auteurs en redacteuren van Nupedia kwam echter het nodige protest tegen het plan om Nupedia zo nauw te associ‡´ren met een webpagina, gebaseerd op het wikiconcept.",Dutch
"Daarom kreeg het nieuwe project per 15 januari de naam 'Wikipedia' en een eigen, onafhankelijk adres op het web.",Dutch
Deze datum werd later uitgeroepen tot Wikipediadag.,Dutch
Nieuwe deelnemers meldden zich aan via een publicatie van Slashdot in maart en juli.,Dutch
"Ook andere publicaties trokken deelnemers, zoals die op Kuro5hin.",Dutch
Zoekmachines (vooral Google) en andere portals dirigeerden dagelijks honderden potenti‡´le deelnemers naar Wikipedia.[bron?],Dutch
Op 12 februari 2001 werd in de Engelstalige Wikipedia de eerste mijlpaal van 1000 artikelen (pagina's) overschreden; daarna groeide het aantal artikelen met circa 1000 per maand en inmiddels (2020) met ongeveer 150.000 per maand[6].,Dutch
Op 19 juni 2001 ging de Nederlandstalige versie van Wikipedia van start.,Dutch
"De oorspronkelijke en verreweg de grootste van alle Wikipedia's is de Engelstalige versie, die van start ging op 15 januari 2001.",Dutch
Het oorspronkelijke doel was te komen tot een minimum van 100.000 artikelen.,Dutch
"Toen dat aantal eenmaal was bereikt, ging de groei echter nog volop door.",Dutch
Vanaf de zomer van 2001 zijn er naast de oorspronkelijke Engelstalige versie steeds meer Wikipedia's in andere talen gestart.,Dutch
"Na de Engelstalige waren in 2015, gemeten naar het aantal individuele artikelen, de Duits-, Frans-, Nederlands- en Zweedstalige Wikipedia's het grootst.",Dutch
"Opgemerkt moet worden dat dit niets zegt over de grootte, de (gemiddelde) kwaliteit of de diversiteit van de artikelen.",Dutch
In totaal waren er in februari 2015 meer dan 34 miljoen artikelen te vinden in 288 verschillende talen.,Dutch
"Er zijn ook enkele Wikipedia's opgestart in minderheidstalen, dialecten en inmiddels uitgestorven talen (zoals het Latijn en Oudengels).",Dutch
Zo bevatte de Wikipedia in het Zazaki begin 2010 ongeveer 2800 artikelen.,Dutch
"Er zijn eveneens versies begonnen in enkele bekende kunsttalen, zoals het Esperanto en het Klingon.",Dutch
[7] Een aantal van deze Wikipedia's bleek echter over onvoldoende vaste bijdragers te beschikken om de projecten draaiende te houden.,Dutch
Deze weinig levensvatbare projecten zijn inmiddels weer gesloten en/of in de Wikimedia Incubator beland.,Dutch
De meeste opslagcapaciteit is nodig voor de afbeeldingen en andere media die op Wikipedia gebruikt worden.,Dutch
Op 15 januari 2009 meldde Wikizine dat er 48 terabyte opslagruimte beschikbaar was gekomen voor Wikimedia Commons.,Dutch
Op dat moment werd daar 5 terabyte van gebruikt.,Dutch
[8] In de maanden augustus en september 2003 werd een internationale logowedstrijd gehouden.,Dutch
Het logo van Paul Stansifer werd met grote meerderheid verkozen.,Dutch
Daarna werd dit aangepast tot een grijze versie op basis van hetzelfde idee.,Dutch
"Vanaf 2005 begonnen de bewerkers (users, in het Nederlands vaak ""gebruikers"" genoemd) op Wikipedia steeds meer samen te werken met culturele instellingen en andere organisaties om meer materiaal beschikbaar te krijgen voor het gebruik op Wikipedia.",Dutch
"Er wordt samengewerkt met onder andere musea, galeries, archieven en bibliotheken om zo meer specialistische informatie en vooral ook beeldmateriaal om meer artikelen hiervan te kunnen voorzien.",Dutch
"In Nederland leverde bijvoorbeeld het Tropenmuseum meer dan 8.000 afbeeldingen over de Marrons, Suriname en Indonesi‡´,[9][10] het Nationaal Archief in Den Haag en Spaarnestad Photo te Haarlem doneren ruim 1100 foto's van Nederlandse politici en belangrijke gebeurtenissen in Nederland[11] en het Amsterdam Museum doneerde in 2011 zijn digitale collectie van 55.000 foto's.",Dutch
[12] De Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed (RCE) heeft in september 2012 van de 555.000 afbeeldingen van haar collectie er 465.000 vrijgegeven met een maximale pixelgrootte van 1200 pixels onder de cc-by-sa-3.0-nl licentie.,Dutch
Sinds 2010 wordt de samenwerking tussen Wikipedia en culturele instellingen verder ge‡Øntensiveerd met de aanstelling van een 'Wikipedian in Residence' bij de instellingen zelf om hun materiaal via Wikipedia te ontsluiten.,Dutch
"[13] Op 15 januari 2016, de 15e verjaardag van Wikipedia, werd bekend dat er een fonds was opgericht, de Wikimedia Endowment, dat de komende 10 jaar 100 miljoen dollar moet gaan inzamelen teneinde het voortbestaan van Wikipedia op de lange termijn te garanderen.",Dutch
[14] In mei 2004 ontving Wikipedia de Golden Nica voor digitale gemeenschappen van de jaarlijkse Prix Ars Electronica-wedstrijd.,Dutch
"Later dat jaar ontving Wikipedia de Judges' Webby Award in de categorie ""community"".",Dutch
"[15] Wikipedia werd ook genomineerd voor de ""Best Practices"" prijs.",Dutch
"In 2007 stemden de lezers van de website brandchannel.com voor Wikipedia als 4de in de lijst van merken, via het antwoord op de vraag ""Welk merk had de grootste invloed op onze levens in 2006?""",Dutch
"In september 2008 ontving Wikipedia de ""Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment"" van Werkstatt Deutschland samen met Boris Tadiƒá, Eckart Hˆfling en Peter Gabriel.",Dutch
Deze prijs werd aangeboden aan Jimbo Wales door David Weinberger.,Dutch
"[16] Op 15 januari 2015 kreeg de Wikipediagemeenschap de Erasmusprijs toegekend, ""omdat zij de verspreiding van kennis heeft bevorderd door een allesomvattende, voor ieder toegankelijke encyclopedie op te zetten"".",Dutch
[17][18] Volgens de organisatie van de prijs droeg Wikipedia door haar open karakter bij aan het besef dat bronnen van kennis niet neutraal zijn en steeds gewogen moeten worden.,Dutch
Met deze kritische aandacht sloot Wikipedia goed aan bij het gedachtegoed van Erasmus.,Dutch
Op 25 november 2015 reikte koning Willem-Alexander deze prijs uit aan drie vertegenwoordigers van de gemeenschap.,Dutch
[19] Op 17 juni 2015 werd de jaarlijkse Prinses van Asturi‡´prijs voor internationale samenwerking toegekend aan Wikipedia.,Dutch
[20] Wikipedia heeft net als andere wiki's te kampen met vandalisme.,Dutch
Hiervoor zijn hulpmiddelen beschikbaar om vandalisme te bestrijden en bijvoorbeeld misbruik van sokpopaccounts op te sporen.,Dutch
'Onzichtbaar vandalisme' en hoaxen blijken echter hardnekkiger te zijn.,Dutch
Door subtiele wijzigingen (beperkte weglatingen of wijziging van de opmaak) kan een heel andere wending aan een artikel worden gegeven.,Dutch
Ook kan iemand per ongeluk foutieve informatie toevoegen.,Dutch
"Wanneer niemand doorheeft dat de informatie onjuist is, kan die maandenlang op Wikipedia blijven staan.",Dutch
"Zo zijn er gevallen bekend van artikelen over niet-bestaande personen, waar wel maandenlang een artikel over bestond.",Dutch
Artikelen op Wikipedia scoren over het algemeen hoog in de zoekmachines.,Dutch
Dit heeft als neveneffect dat ook eventuele foutieve informatie zich vanaf Wikipedia snel over het internet kan verspreiden.,Dutch
Wikipedia wordt bewerkt door vrijwilligers en heeft een open structuur.,Dutch
In principe kan iedereen daardoor meewerken aan de encyclopedie.,Dutch
In de praktijk blijkt er echter geen sprake van een volledige afspiegeling van de maatschappij.,Dutch
Zo komt uit onderzoek van de Wikimedia Foundation naar enkele kenmerken van bewerkers van Wikipedia naar voren dat de meerderheid van de bewerkers mannelijk is en geen partner en kinderen heeft.,Dutch
"Ongeveer de helft valt in de leeftijd tussen 18 en 30 jaar oud, terwijl de groep jonger dan 18 zo'n 25% bedraagt.",Dutch
"Het dominante profiel van de bewerkers heeft - algemeen gesproken - gevolgen voor het soort en aantal artikelen en daarnaast ook voor de inhoud van artikelen, wat Dale Hoiberg, voormalig hoofdredacteur van de Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica, een systematische fout of bias noemt.",Dutch
"In vergelijking met traditionele encyclopedie‡´n is er dan ook meer aandacht voor sporters, informatica en popcultuur, terwijl onderwerpen als natuurwetenschap, taal, kunst en Afrika soms ondervertegenwoordigd zijn.",Dutch
Zo was bijvoorbeeld het artikel over de stripfiguren Casper en Hobbes op de Engelstalige Wikipedia een tijdlang uitgebreider dan dat over William Shakespeare.,Dutch
The Guardian gaf in 2014 aan dat een artikel op de Engelstalige Wikipedia met een lijst van porno-actrices meer voetnoten kende dan dat met een lijst van schrijfsters.,Dutch
"[21] Dit werd al vroeg onderkend, zoals bleek uit projecten als CROSSBOW en het wikiproject systematische bias, die echter niet van lange duur waren.",Dutch
Naast de kenmerken in het onderzoek van de Wikimedia Foundation spelen ook andere kenmerken een rol.,Dutch
"Zo verschilt de demografie per Wikipedia sterk, wat zijn invloed heeft op het soort artikelen en de inhoud daarvan.",Dutch
"Artikelen over bepaalde landen, volken, gebruiken en religies zullen niet op elke Wikipedia dezelfde aandacht krijgen.",Dutch
Andere initiatieven zijn onder meer het wegwerken van overmatige nadruk in artikelen op specifieke landen.,Dutch
[noot 1] De bewerkers van Wikipedia zijn merendeels mannelijk.,Dutch
"Daarom schreef de New Statesman dat de Engelstalige versie niet de ""sum of all knowledge"" was - de visie van Jimmy Wales, een van de oprichters van Wikipedia - maar eerder de ""sum of male knowledge"".",Dutch
[22] In het tijdschrift Slate noemde Heather Mac Donald dit in 2011 echter geen probleem: De eenvoudigste verklaring voor het verschil in deelname (...) is dat mannen en vrouwen gemiddeld andere interesses hebben en hun vrije tijd op een andere manier willen besteden.,Dutch
"[23] In 2011 bleek uit onderzoek dat de Engelstalige Wikipedia weliswaar meer artikelen over vrouwen had dan de Encyclopaedia Britannica, maar ook dat de kans dat een artikel over een vrouw ontbrak groter was dan over een man.",Dutch
Dat effect was bovendien sterker in de Wikipedia dan in de Britannica.,Dutch
[24] Uit onderzoek uit 2015 bleek dat de biografie‡´n van vrouwen heel anders geschreven waren dan die van mannen.,Dutch
[25] Het gebrek aan artikelen over vrouwen werd belangrijk genoeg gevonden om met verschillende nieuwe projecten weg te werken.,Dutch
"Op de presentatie van artikelen in de userinterface van Wikipedia wordt wel kritiek geuit, omdat deze niet modern, rommelig en niet gebruiksvriendelijk zou zijn.",Dutch
"Een modernere presentatie van deze artikelen wordt bijvoorbeeld geboden door Wikiwand, een gepatenteerde software-interface die hiervoor is ontwikkeld.",Dutch
Wikiwand is zelf geen onderdeel van MediaWiki.,Dutch
In Het Financieele Dagblad verscheen in 2016 een artikel waarin werd gesteld dat Wikipedia negatief bijdraagt aan de economische groei.,Dutch
[noot 2][26] Wikipedia werd al eerder gezien als een oneerlijke concurrent voor traditionele encyclopedie‡´n.,Dutch
"Nicholas Carr viel in The amorality of Web 2.0 (2005, Web 2.0 is amoreel) websites met gebruikersbijdragen als Wikipedia aan, omdat ze beroepsschrijvers (die volgens hem superieur zijn) het brood uit de mond kunnen stoten, want ""gratis wint altijd van kwaliteit"".",Dutch
"Carr schreef: ""De geestdriftige visioenen van Web 2.0 gaan er stilzwijgend van uit dat de amateur de overhand krijgt.",Dutch
"Maar ik kan me niets angstaanjagenders voorstellen"".",Dutch
[27] Anderen bestrijden dat Wikipedia of iets dergelijks de traditionele publicaties volledig gaat verdringen.,Dutch
"Chris Anderson, hoofdredacteur van Wired Magazine, beweerde in het natuurwetenschappelijke tijdschrift Nature dat Wikipedia met haar gebruik van groepsverstand (wisdom of crowds) de wetenschappelijke toptijdschriften niet zal vervangen, vanwege de andere rol en strenge procedures voor collegiale toetsing van die tijdschriften.",Dutch
[28] Wikipedia zou censuur willen vermijden.,Dutch
Zo werd in 2006 op de Duitstalige Wikipedia geweigerd om de naam van een overleden hacker te verwijderen toen de familie daarom vroeg.,Dutch
"[29] Ook werd in 2008 een platenhoes niet verwijderd nadat een Britse organisatie die hoes als kinderpornografie had bestempeld, waardoor in grote delen van het Verenigd Koninkrijk Wikipedia niet meer bereikbaar was.",Dutch
[30] Turkije blokkeerde van 29 april 2017 tot 16 januari 2020[31] de toegang tot alle talenversies van Wikipedia nadat de encyclopedie had geweigerd sommige inhoud te verwijderen.,Dutch
"[32][33] Niettemin werd in 2009 wel informatie verwijderd over de ontvoering van David S. Rohde door de taliban, omdat volgens de New York Times zijn leven in gevaar kon komen door het bekendmaken van de ontvoering.",Dutch
"[34] T. Bayer gaf in 2012 een overzicht van verschillende onderzoeken, die uitwezen dat de Engelse en Duitse Wikipedia gemiddeld betrouwbaar waren.",Dutch
"[35] Een vergelijking in september 2004 van de Duitstalige Wikipedia en twee andere Duitstalige encyclopedie‡´n, Brockhaus en Encarta, door het computertijdschrift c't, viel in het voordeel van Wikipedia uit.",Dutch
In 2005 publiceerde Nature de resultaten van een vergelijkend onderzoek naar de kwaliteit van artikelen in de Engelse Wikipedia (WP) en de Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica (EB).,Dutch
"[36] Universitaire deskundigen bogen zich over natuurwetenschappelijke teksten, zonder te weten uit welke encyclopedie ze kwamen.",Dutch
In 42 paren van overeenkomstige artikelen uit beide encyclopedie‡´n vonden ze zowel in WP als in EB totaal acht ernstige fouten.,Dutch
"Gemiddeld bevatte een WP-artikel vier en een EB-artikel drie foutjes, weglatingen of misleidende beweringen.",Dutch
"Nature concludeerde dat hoewel de schrijfstijl van de Britannica veel beter was, de Wikipedia op natuurwetenschappelijk gebied bijna net zo goed was als de Britannica.",Dutch
Orlowski formuleerde het als volgt: de kwaliteit van informatie in deze artikelen was in Wikipedia daarmee 31 procent minder dan in de Britannica.,Dutch
[37] Het betrof hier een betrekkelijk kleine selectie van artikelen over exacte wetenschappen en techniek en veel van de aangetroffen 'fouten' betroffen meningsverschillen tussen de onderzoekers van Nature en de redacteuren van de Britannica over welke feiten vermeld zouden moeten worden in een encyclopedie.,Dutch
"[38] In maart 2006 publiceerde de Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica onder de titel ""Fatally Flawed"" een weerlegging van de onderzoeksresultaten van Nature.",Dutch
[39] Er bestaan op het internet een aantal klonen Äì ook wel mirrors of spiegelsites genoemd Äì van Wikipedia.,Dutch
Dit zijn websites die de inhoud van Wikipedia-artikelen of een deel hiervan (vrijwel) letterlijk overnemen.,Dutch
"Enkele voorbeelden zijn DBpedia, EverybodyWiki Bios & Wiki, Wikiwand en (specifiek in het Nederlands) Encyclo.nl.",Dutch
Ook sommige teksten op WordPress.com zijn min of meer letterlijk afkomstig van Wikipedia.,Dutch
"Daarnaast wordt veel van de vrij beschikbare inhoud van Wikipedia door allerlei individuele sites overgenomen en hergebruikt, al dan niet in de vorm van letterlijk gekopieerde tekstpassages.",Dutch
"Regelmatig laten deze sites na om de bron van deze informatie correct weer te geven, waardoor de vereiste auteursrechtelijke kennisgevingen niet gerealiseerd worden.",Dutch
"Een belangrijk neveneffect van dergelijke ""kloonwebsites"" en andere sites die zich primair op Wikipedia baseren is dat ze ervoor zorgen dat informatie op het internet steeds eenzijdiger wordt.",Dutch
"Het is geen zeldzaamheid dat vijf van de eerste tien zoekresultaten op Google allemaal hetzelfde artikel bevatten, op verschillende sites.",Dutch
Foutieve informatie kan op deze manier snel over het internet worden verspreid.,Dutch
Critici van Wikipedia zien dit als een zorgelijke ontwikkeling.,Dutch
"Automatisch leren of machinaal leren is een breed onderzoeksveld binnen kunstmatige intelligentie, dat zich bezighoudt met de ontwikkeling van algoritmes en technieken waarmee computers kunnen leren.",Dutch
De methodes zijn te verdelen in twee ruwe categorie‡´n: aanleidinggevend en deductief.,Dutch
Aanleidinggevende methodes cre‡´ren computerprogramma's door het vormen van regels of het extraheren van patronen uit data.,Dutch
Deductieve methoden hebben als resultaat een functie die net zo generiek is als de invoerdata.,Dutch
"Automatisch leren is sterk gerelateerd aan statistiek, aangezien beide velden de studie van data analyseren.",Dutch
Automatisch leren is meer gericht op de algoritmische complexiteit of de implementatie in programma's.,Dutch
"Het is ook gerelateerd aan datamining, waarin op een geautomatiseerde manier patronen en relaties worden gezocht in grote hoeveelheden gegevens.",Dutch

waren magische wezens iets waarvan de moeder van narcisse niets wist van terry melli oh het is zo goed om je te zien het is erg lang geleden hoe gaat het met je ik ben heel goed geweest ik zou beter zijn geweest als alleen maar wat als mijn dochter narcisa een beetje meer begrip had marian vertelde mellie en badstof alles over narcisa en hoe ze zich zorgen maakte om haar ze wil eten brood gemaakt van goud wat moet ik met haar doen nou misschien als haar droom uitkomt.,Dutch
"dat zou geweldig zijn, zou het niet goed zijn, ik denk dat ze na verloop van tijd zal groeien om te leren, laten we over iets anders praten.",Dutch
nu later zwaaiden Mellie en Terry hun oude vriend gedag en gingen die avond zowel moeder als dochter lachend naar elkaar weg.,Dutch
klaarmaken voor bed moeder ik hoop echt dat mijn droom uitkomt weet je oh narcisa de volgende dag als narcisa en haar moeder waren buiten in hun tuin een prachtige.,Dutch
"gouden koets kwam aanrijden, bezaaid met edelstenen en diamanten en zag er buitengewoon verbluffend uit.",Dutch
toen het stopte kwam er een knappe man tevoorschijn en keek naar narcisa.,Dutch
Ze was helemaal verbaasd over hoe knap hij was.,Dutch
Mijn droom komt echt uit umm.,Dutch
"wat hallo ik ben hier gekomen om narcissushand in het huwelijk te vragen, maar hoe weet je haar naam en wie ben jij.",Dutch
"ik ben terrence de engel van het geluk de naam en de schoonheid van je dochter is over de hele wereld bekend hier ik heb je een geschenk meegebracht, maar je kent hem nauwelijks, je kunt niet met hem meegaan.",Dutch
oh dom hij is rijk en knap wat wil ik nog meer terrence ik accepteer je voorstel.,Dutch
"en daarmee stapte ze in zijn rijtuig en zonder zelfs maar afscheid te nemen van haar moeder reed het rijtuig weg met de engel terwijl ze aan het reizen waren, ging het rijtuig plotseling een magisch portaal binnen, daar reisde het door een stormachtig gebied, het rijtuig botste enorm rond en narcis.",Dutch
"was erg bang, maak je geen zorgen mijn liefste, dit alles zal snel voorbij zijn, net zoals hij dit zei, het rijtuig ging door een ander portaal en bereikte de oprit.",Dutch
"van een enorm en prachtig gouden kasteel narcisa was verbaasd over al het moois dat ze zag ik wist dat ik zoveel rijkdom verdien ik wist dat je het leuk zou vinden alles wat je wilt vind je hier van de mooiste jurken tot het lekkerste eten allemaal in mijn paleis goed sprekend over eten ik heb echt honger na die rit ik ' m uitgehongerd mag ik iets van dat lekkere eten natuurlijk hier vlees stinkende melissa ze zal je krijgen wat je maar wilt ik heb zoveel over je gehoord je arm schat je hebt honger, kom je niet, laten we naar de eettafel gaan en ik zal wat eten voor je halen, oh dank je, ze gingen naar de eetkamer en daar op de tafel stond het meest verbazingwekkende voedsel dat narcisa ooit had gezien, geweldig, dat komt omdat de jam wordt gemaakt.",Dutch
van robijnen de salades van smaragden en het brood daar is gemaakt van goudgoud brood hoe mooi deze jam eruit zal zien en heerlijk zal smaken met het brood ze nam een sneetje erbij.,Dutch
"robijnrode jam erop en nam een enorme hap dit is zo heet ik kan niet zo goed eten het is brood van goud en het beste ook maar als je het niet kunt eten moet ik je zilver brood zilver geven he, waarom niet jij eet.",Dutch
"iets anders maar ik wil gewoon brood brood dat ik kan eten, heb je niet die look zo aanstaande vrouw van mijn vader, het is koud je moet alleen de beste narcis eten.",Dutch
Ik heb naar al het eten gekeken.,Dutch
maar was diepbedroefd voor alles wat er oneetbaar was.,Dutch
"Ze begon al snel te huilen, ik wil dit niet, maar het eten is echt goed.",Dutch
"probeer hier wat gouden aardappelen, ze zijn echt goed en nadat je met mij bent getrouwd.",Dutch
je moet dit allemaal opeten.,Dutch
Ik dacht dat je van mooie dingen hield.,Dutch
"Nee, ik wil niet met je trouwen.",Dutch
Ik wil naar huis.,Dutch
naar mijn moeder laat me naar huis gaan melissa en terrence keken elkaar aan en knipogen goed.,Dutch
"als dat echt is wat je wilt, dan neem ik je mee naar huis.",Dutch
Terrence nam het huilen en ongelukkig op.,Dutch
narcis thuis in de koets begon ze diep na te denken over de keuzes die ze had gemaakt toen ze thuiskwam.,Dutch
"ze rende om haar moeder te omhelzen die in het huis zat, verdrietig, noch zus o mijn lieve dochter, ik dacht dat ik je nooit meer zou zien.",Dutch
oh mam ik hou zo veel van je en je had gelijk uiterlijk en rijkdom is niet alles het gouden brood was nutteloos omdat ik het niet kon eten en de man ook al.,Dutch
hij was knap hij gaf helemaal niet om me maar mijn liefste besef je dat dat precies de manier is waarop je anderen behandelde.,Dutch
"Ik weet dat het me zo spijt van de manier waarop ik me gedroeg mam oh nee het is goed sinds je het hebt gezien wat je fout was, kom, laten we je vanaf die dag iets lekkers geven.",Dutch
"narcisa veranderde haar manier van doen ze worstelde eerst maar langzaam en geduldig begon ze een stuk aardiger te worden op een dag dat mellie en badstof marian weer kwamen ontmoeten oh hallo jullie twee, dus vertel het ons marian.",Dutch
hoe' Marian vertelde hun nu allebei alles wat er was gebeurd en ze is sinds die tijd zo veranderd.,Dutch
"heeft ze, denk ik dat ze nu geen goudbrood meer zou willen, weet je.",Dutch
"Terry je lijkt eigenlijk een beetje op die engel, maar wat zie ik, hoe kun je hem zijn jullie twee zijn zo aardig",Dutch
"Nature es una de las m‡s prestigiosas revistas cient‡≠ficas a nivel mundial,[1] que fue fundada por Joseph Norman Lockyer.",Spanish
Su primer n˙mero fue publicado el 4 de noviembre de 1869.,Spanish
"[2] Con una periodicidad semanal, la revista es publicada en Reino Unido por la compaÒ‡≠a Nature Publishing Group, subsidiaria de Macmillan Publishers, propiedad del Grupo Editorial Holtzbrinck (dueÒos del semanario Die Zeit).",Spanish
"Nature tiene oficinas en Londres, Nueva York, San Francisco, Washington D. C., Tokio, Par‡≠s, M˙nich y Basingstoke, y dispone de corresponsales propios en la mayor‡≠a de los pa‡≠ses industrializados.",Spanish
"La editorial publica tambiÈn varias revistas especializadas bajo el nombre de Nature como Nature Neuroscience, Nature Methods y Nature Structural and Molecular Biology entre otros t‡≠tulos.",Spanish
La revista es le‡≠da por cient‡≠ficos e investigadores de todo el mundo siendo la mayor parte de los art‡≠culos exposiciones de trabajos de investigaciÛn muy tÈcnicos.,Spanish
"Sin embargo tambiÈn incluye editoriales y noticias cient‡≠ficas de car‡cter general as‡≠ como art‡≠culos sobre pol‡≠tica cient‡≠fica en diferentes pa‡≠ses, cr‡≠ticas de libros tÈcnicos y de divulgaciÛn y art‡≠culos sobre la historia y el futuro de algunas disciplinas cient‡≠ficas.",Spanish
"Seg˙n los Journal Citation Reports, la revista tiene un factor de impacto de 41,456.",Spanish
[3] Para la mayor‡≠a de los cient‡≠ficos publicar en Nature constituye una marca de prestigio.,Spanish
La revista rechaza en torno al 95% de los art‡≠culos que le son enviados para la revisiÛn por pares.,Spanish
[4] Los art‡≠culos publicados aparecen en ocasiones reseÒados por la prensa general y se considera que se encuentran en el frente de la investigaciÛn cient‡≠fica.,Spanish
"Algunos art‡≠culos famosos publicados por Nature fueron: En 2007 fue galardonada con el Premio Pr‡≠ncipe de Asturias de ComunicaciÛn y Humanidades, junto con la revista Science, ´por su labor durante m‡s de un siglo impulsando y difundiendo las grandes conquistas cient‡≠ficas de la Humanidad acercando de este modo la ciencia a la vidaª.",Spanish
[6] Los art‡≠culos publicados en Nature se someten a un riguroso sistema de arbitraje por expertos internacionales en cada ‡rea del conocimiento.,Spanish
Los art‡≠culos publicados han pasado el filtro de la revisiÛn por pares.,Spanish
"En casos dudosos, algunos de los experimentos son repetidos por otros cient‡≠ficos confidencialmente antes de su publicaciÛn.",Spanish
Los editores de la revista realizan tambiÈn una importante criba determinando si el art‡≠culo es o no de interÈs general y si est‡ o no entre los temas de interÈs cient‡≠fico superior.,Spanish
"A pesar de todos estos filtros, algunos art‡≠culos publicados por la revista constituyeron famosos esc‡ndalos al demostrarse la falsedad de los resultados presentados.",Spanish
Tales fueron los casos de la memoria del agua o la fusiÛn fr‡≠a.,Spanish
"Wikipedia es una enciclopedia libre,[nota 2] pol‡≠glota y editada de manera colaborativa.",Spanish
"Es administrada por la FundaciÛn Wikimedia, una organizaciÛn sin ‡nimo de lucro cuya financiaciÛn est‡ basada en donaciones.",Spanish
"Sus m‡s de 50 millones de art‡≠culos en 300 idiomas han sido redactados en conjunto por voluntarios de todo el mundo,[5] lo que suma m‡s de 2000 millones de ediciones, y permite que cualquier persona pueda sumarse al proyecto[6] para editarlos, a menos que la p‡gina se encuentre protegida contra vandalismos para evitar problemas o disputas.",Spanish
"Fue creada el 15 de enero de 2001 por Jimmy Wales y Larry Sanger,[7] y es la mayor y m‡s popular obra de consulta en Internet.",Spanish
"[8][9][10] Desde su fundaciÛn, Wikipedia no solo ha ganado en popularidad Äîse encuentra entre los 20 sitios web m‡s populares del mundoÄî,[11][12] sino que adem‡s su Èxito ha propiciado la apariciÛn de proyectos hermanos: Wikcionario, Wikilibros, Wikiversidad, Wikiquote, Wikinoticias, Wikisource, Wikiespecies y Wikiviajes.",Spanish
Existen tres caracter‡≠sticas esenciales del proyecto Wikipedia que definen en conjunto su funciÛn en la web.,Spanish
"El lema ´La enciclopedia libre que todos pueden editarª explica los tres principios:[13] Seg˙n su cofundador, Jimmy Wales, el proyecto constituye ´un esfuerzo para crear y distribuir una enciclopedia libre, de la m‡s alta calidad posible, a cada persona del planeta, en su idiomaª, para lograr ´un mundo en el que cada persona del planeta tenga acceso libre a la suma de todo el saber de la humanidadª.",Spanish
[14] Se desarrolla en el sitio Wikipedia.org haciendo uso de un software wiki ÄîtÈrmino originalmente usado para el WikiWikiWebÄî.,Spanish
Wikipedia ha recibido diversas cr‡≠ticas.,Spanish
"Algunos la han acusado de parcialidad sistÈmica y de inconsistencias,[15] con cr‡≠ticas sobre la pol‡≠tica del proyecto enciclopÈdico de favorecer el consenso sobre las credenciales en su proceso editorial[16][17] Otras cr‡≠ticas han estado centradas en su susceptibilidad de ser vandalizada y en la apariciÛn de informaciÛn espuria o falta de verificaciÛn,[18] aunque estudios eruditos sugieren que el vandalismo en general es deshecho con prontitud.",Spanish
"[19][20] De las 300 ediciones, diecisiete superan el 1†000†000 de art‡≠culos: inglÈs, cebuano, sueco, alem‡n,  francÈs, neerlandÈs, ruso, italiano, espaÒol, polaco, samareÒo, vietnamita, japonÈs, chino, ‡rabe, portuguÈs y ucraniano.",Spanish
"[nota 3] Una buena parte de sus ediciones idiom‡ticas est‡ disponible para ser utilizada offline, distribuida en DVD u otros soportes.",Spanish
[21] Muchas de sus ediciones han sido replicadas a travÈs de Internet Äîmediante ´espejosªÄî y han dado origen a enciclopedias derivadas ÄîbifurcacionesÄî en otros sitios web.,Spanish
"[22] Wikipedia ha sido criticada por exhibir sesgos sistÈmicos y por estar sujeta a manipulaciÛn y giro en temas controvertidos;[23] Edwin Black ha criticado a Wikipedia por presentar una mezcla de ""verdad, verdad a medias y algunas falsedades"".",Spanish
"[24] Wikipedia tambiÈn ha sido criticada por prejuicios de gÈnero, particularmente en su versiÛn en inglÈs, donde la mayor‡≠a de los editores son hombres.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, se han realizado maratones de ediciÛn para alentar a las editoras y aumentar la cobertura de temas relacionados con la mujer.",Spanish
[25] Facebook anunciÛ que para 2017 ayudar‡≠a a los lectores a detectar noticias falsas sugiriendo enlaces a art‡≠culos relacionados de Wikipedia.,Spanish
YouTube anunciÛ un plan similar en 2018.,Spanish
"[26] Es uno de los 15 sitios web m‡s populares seg˙n la clasificaciÛn de Alexa, en enero de 2021 y la revista The Economist la colocÛ como el ""decimotercer lugar m‡s visitado en la web"".",Spanish
"[27] Sin publicidad, est‡ alojado por la FundaciÛn Wikimedia, una organizaciÛn estadounidense sin fines de lucro financiada principalmente a travÈs de donaciones.",Spanish
"[28] Wales cita el ensayo ""El uso del conocimiento en la sociedad"", escrito por el economista y filÛsofo de la escuela austriaca y Premio Nobel de Econom‡≠a Friedrich Hayek, que leyÛ cuando era estudiante,[29] como ´centralª para su pensamiento acerca de ´cÛmo gestionar el proyecto Wikipediaª[30][31][32][33] Hayek argumenta que la informaciÛn est‡ descentralizada Äîcada individuo solo conoce una pequeÒa fracciÛn de lo que se conoce colectivamenteÄî y, como resultado, las decisiones se toman mejor por aquellos con conocimientos locales, en lugar de por una autoridad central.",Spanish
"[30][34] Wales reconsiderÛ el ensayo de Hayek en la dÈcada de 1990, mientras estaba leyendo sobre el movimiento de cÛdigo abierto, que abogaba por la distribuciÛn gratuita de software libre.",Spanish
"Fue particularmente conmovido por el ensayo ""La catedral y el bazar"" escrito por uno de los fundadores del movimiento, Eric S. Raymond y adaptado m‡s adelante en un libro.",Spanish
Wales afirmÛ que ese ensayo ´abriÛ [sus] ojos a las posibilidades de colaboraciÛn masivaª.,Spanish
"[29] En marzo de 2000, Jimmy Wales creÛ Nupedia, un proyecto de enciclopedia libre basado en un ambicioso y exhaustivo proceso de revisiÛn por pares,[35] diseÒado para hacer sus art‡≠culos de una calidad comparable a la de las enciclopedias profesionales gracias a la participaciÛn de eruditos Äìprincipalmente doctorandos y acadÈmicosÄî, a los que se propon‡≠a colaborar de modo no remunerado.",Spanish
"El proyecto tuvo el apoyo econÛmico de la empresa Bomis, fundada por Wales y administrada por este junto con un compaÒero desde 1996,[36] y la colaboraciÛn de Richard Stallman, quien propuso el cambio a la licencia p˙blica general de GNU, desde la antigua Nupedia Open Content License.",Spanish
"[37] Larry Sanger, doctor en filosof‡≠a, que ya conoc‡≠a anteriormente a Wales de mantener con Èl discusiones filosÛficas por Internet, fue contratado por este y se convirtiÛ en redactor jefe de Nupedia.",Spanish
"[36] Debido al lento avance del proyecto, en 2001 se creÛ un wiki ÄîUseModÄî vinculado a Nupedia cuya finalidad inicial era agilizar la creaciÛn de art‡≠culos de forma paralela, antes de que estos pasaran al sistema de revisiÛn por expertos.",Spanish
"Existe cierta polÈmica entre los fundadores de Nupedia sobre quiÈn propuso originalmente la idea de usar un wiki a Jimbo Wales, si Larry Sanger o bien una tercera persona,[38] pero el caso es que el Èxito de aquel ´pequeÒo proyecto paraleloª ÄîWikipediaÄî acabÛ eclipsando a Nupedia, que dejÛ de funcionar en 2003.",Spanish
El proyecto Wikipedia se iniciÛ el 15 de enero de 2001.,Spanish
"El art‡≠culo m‡s antiguo que puede encontrarse en Wikipedia es UuU, creado el 16 de enero de 2001 en la versiÛn inglesa; consist‡≠a en tres enlaces hacia sendos art‡≠culos sobre el Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y Uruguay.",Spanish
"[39]
Larry Sanger pasÛ a colaborar con Wikipedia y trabajÛ activamente en la organizaciÛn y directrices del proyecto; se marchÛ en 2002 por desacuerdos con Wales.",Spanish
"[36] Ese aÒo, Wikipedia abarcaba 26 idiomas, 46 en 2003 y 161 a finales de 2004.",Spanish
Wikipedia y Nupedia coexistieron hasta la extinciÛn de la segunda en 2003.,Spanish
"[40]
Sin embargo, la posibilidad de utilizar publicidad en Wikipedia provocÛ una reacciÛn de parte de los contribuyentes de la Wikipedia en espaÒol, motivo que llevÛ a la creaciÛn de la Enciclopedia Libre Universal en EspaÒol en febrero de 2002.",Spanish
"[41] Este episodio podr‡≠a haber impulsado a su vez la determinaciÛn de no utilizar publicidad, la creaciÛn de la FundaciÛn Wikimedia y el cambio al nuevo url.",Spanish
"[42] Se han iniciado otros varios proyectos de enciclopedia con formato wiki, en gran parte bajo una filosof‡≠a diferente de la apertura y el modelo editorial del ´punto de vista neutralª desarrollado por Wikipedia.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, Wikinfo, uno de los portales web, no requiere un punto de vista neutral y permite la investigaciÛn original.",Spanish
"[43] TambiÈn hubo nuevos proyectos inspirados en Wikipedia Äîcomo Citizendium, Scholarpedia, Conservapedia, y Knol de Google[44]Äî donde algunos de los aspectos que son fundamentales en Wikipedia se abordan de manera diferenciada, como las pol‡≠ticas de revisiÛn por pares, la investigaciÛn original, y la publicidad comercial.",Spanish
"El 20 de septiembre de 2004, Wikipedia alcanzÛ 1 millÛn de art‡≠culos en 100 idiomas.",Spanish
"[45] En 2007 la versiÛn en inglÈs superÛ los 2 millones de art‡≠culos, convirtiÈndose en la enciclopedia con mayor n˙mero de art‡≠culos de la historia y superando en ese aspecto a la Yongle Dadian de 1407, que sostuvo el rÈcord durante varios siglos.",Spanish
"[46] Debido a su popularidad y sencillez, el Oxford English Dictionary ha considerado introducir el tÈrmino wiki.",Spanish
"[47] En octubre de 2011, Wikimedia anunciÛ el lanzamiento de Wikipedia Zero, una iniciativa para permitir el acceso gratuito mÛvil (datos) a la Wikipedia en pa‡≠ses del tercer mundo a travÈs de colaboraciones con operadores de telecomunicaciones mÛviles.",Spanish
"[48][49] La palabra Wikipedia, nombre propio acuÒado por Larry Sanger a principios de 2001, es la contracciÛn de wiki, una tecnolog‡≠a para crear sitios web colaborativos, procedente a su vez de wikiwiki, 'r‡pido' en hawaiano,[50] y encyclopedia, 'enciclopedia' en inglÈs.",Spanish
[51] Este nombre se pronuncia en inglÈs como (AFI).,Spanish
"La Wikipedia en espaÒol, creada meses despuÈs, heredÛ el nombre.",Spanish
"Tras una votaciÛn realizada entre septiembre y noviembre de 2003 por parte de los usuarios de esta, se decidiÛ seguir con el mismo tÈrmino.",Spanish
"En la votaciÛn se barajaron los siguientes nombres Äîpor orden de popularidadÄî: Librepedia, Huiquipedia, Uiquipedia, G¸iquipedia, Viquipedia, ‡ëiquipedia, Velozpedia, Limonpedia, G¸isquipedia y Velocipedia.",Spanish
"[52] Otros que tambiÈn usaron el nombre Wikipedia fueron los idiomas Äîordenados seg˙n el ISO 639-3Äî: alem‡n, bretÛn, corso, danÈs, euskera, filipino, finlandÈs, gallego, neerlandÈs, indonesio, islandÈs, italiano, nauruano, noruego, polaco, rumano, siciliano, somal‡≠, suajili y sueco.",Spanish
Esta es una lista de las graf‡≠as alternativas usadas para nombrar a Wikipedia en las diferentes ediciones:[53] Nota: Cada asterisco (*) denota una referencia respectiva por la m˙ltiple adopciÛn ling¸‡≠stica.,Spanish
"Desde su inicio en 2001, Wikipedia ha utilizado diferentes marcas corporativas.",Spanish
"El elemento com˙n en todas ellas es una esfera escrita como elemento central, simbolizando el mundo y el conocimiento.",Spanish
"En 2003 se adoptÛ por concurso internacional el dibujo de una esfera incompleta, conocida como globo-rompecabezas, compuesta por piezas de un rompecabezas de varios colores, con enlaces en azul pertenecientes a distintas escrituras del mundo, simbolizando as‡≠ la condiciÛn de ´obra en construcciÛnª que tiene Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[54] El diseÒo que ganÛ el concurso internacional sufriÛ algunas modificaciones antes de ser aprobado como logo oficial, principalmente la eliminaciÛn del color y el reemplazo de los enlaces por grafemas de diversas escrituras del mundo.",Spanish
La denuncia de diversos errores e inconsistencias en los s‡≠mbolos incluidos en el globo-rompecabezas y la posibilidad de diseÒar una imagen animada o fotorrealista impulsÛ entre diversos editores de Wikipedia un debate sobre la posibilidad de realizar modificaciones en el elemento gr‡fico.,Spanish
"Como consecuencia, y tras la labor realizada a travÈs de una iniciativa de la FundaciÛn Wikimedia junto a miles de voluntarios para modificar la interfaz de la enciclopedia, el dibujo de la globo-rompecabezas fue reemplazado en 2010 por un modelo tridimensional, en el que algunos s‡≠mbolos de las piezas de rompecabezas fueron reemplazados por otros, principalmente aquellos que constituyen el primer grafema de la palabra ""Wikipedia"" en distintas wikipedias que existen en el mundo.",Spanish
"Por aÒadidura, se cambiÛ la tipograf‡≠a del elemento denominativo Äî´WIKIPEDIA, La enciclopedia libreªÄî para usar la fuente abierta Linux Libertine, con excepciÛn de la W inicial, que se mantiene con la fuente Hoefler Text y constituye tambiÈn uno de los s‡≠mbolos oficiales.",Spanish
[55][56][57] Cada Wikipedia seg˙n idioma es autÛnoma y tiene facultades para elegir la marca que la identifique.,Spanish
"A partir de 2003 todas han adoptado b‡sicamente la misma, con el elemento denominativo ´Wikipedia, The free encyclopediaª Äî´Wikipedia, La enciclopedia libreªÄî traducido al idioma en que se escribe cada una.",Spanish
"Las marcas han sido realizadas voluntaria y gratuitamente por usuarios de Wikipedia, y sus derechos pertenecen a la FundaciÛn Wikimedia.",Spanish
"Han existido y existen muchas enciclopedias en l‡≠nea que compitieron con Wikipedia, como Microsoft Encarta y Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica; sin embargo, ninguna ha logrado el mismo Èxito que Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[59][60] Wikipedia busca crear un resumen de todo el conocimiento humano, con cada tema cubierto enciclopÈdicamente en un art‡≠culo.",Spanish
"Como tiene terabytes de espacio disponible, puede abarcar muchos m‡s temas que cualquier enciclopedia impresa.",Spanish
"El grado exacto y la forma de cobertura en Wikipedia se encuentran en constante revisiÛn por parte de sus editores, y los desacuerdos no son infrecuentes, tal como lo demuestra la controversia sobre eliminaciÛn de contenidos.",Spanish
"[61][62] Seg˙n un estudio realizado por la revista Nature en 2007, ´Wikipedia alcanzaba a la Enciclopedia Brit‡nicaª en calidad,[63] aunque existe controversia sobre este asunto.",Spanish
"[64][65] Adem‡s, sus contenidos est‡n disponibles en formato impreso.",Spanish
"[66][67] Otro estudio realizado por la Universidad Carnegie Mellon y Palo Alto Research Center sobre las mayores categor‡≠as de art‡≠culos en la Wikipedia en inglÈs desde julio de 2006 hasta enero de 2008, arrojÛ los siguientes resultados:[68] Para la visualizaciÛn de art‡≠culos, la fundaciÛn Wikimedia rediseÒÛ la interfaz con un tema o tapiz que se conoce como vector, creado en 2010.",Spanish
"[69][70] Antes de la actualizaciÛn, aÒos atr‡s exist‡≠a una interfaz cl‡sica conocida como Monobook con limitadas caracter‡≠sticas.",Spanish
"[71] Dentro de la interfaz, existen variedad de mandos usados para navegar o editar p‡ginas.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, para buscar, ir a otros enlaces o ampliar im‡genes como otros sitios web.",Spanish
"Adem‡s, mediante las pestaÒas, pueden navegar, interaccionar o colaborar con otras p‡ginas.",Spanish
"Aunque algunas actividades de mantenimiento, son ocultas para los usuarios no registrados en el proyecto.",Spanish
"Para editar un art‡≠culo se recurre al cÛdigo wiki en una caja de texto a travÈs de la pestaÒa ""Editar"" que no siempre est‡ disponible en caso de alguna prevenciÛn contra el vandalismo.",Spanish
"Entre sus mandos, no se asemejan al cl‡sico HTML; por ejemplo para los enlaces se usan corchetes, signos iguales para los t‡≠tulos, entre otros, lo cual puede dar una mala impresiÛn a aquellas personas que no tengan conocimientos en Inform‡tica.",Spanish
"[72] En octubre de 2016, Wikipedia abarcaba 284 ediciones ´activasª en distintos idiomas y dialectos.",Spanish
"Cada ediciÛn trabaja de forma independiente, no est‡ obligada a incluir el contenido de otras ediciones, y solo debe respetar pol‡≠ticas globales tales como la de mantener un ´punto de vista neutralª.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, se comparten algunos art‡≠culos e im‡genes entre las diversas ediciones de Wikipedia o a travÈs del repositorio de Wikimedia Commons, y se solicitan traducciones organizadas de art‡≠culos procedentes de otras ediciones.",Spanish
Los art‡≠culos traducidos representan solamente una pequeÒa parte del total en cualquiera de ellas.,Spanish
"[73] Las cinco ediciones con m‡s art‡≠culos son, en orden descendente, inglÈs, sueco, neerlandÈs, alem‡n y francÈs.",Spanish
"En enero de 2011, Wikipedia conten‡≠a 278 ediciones Äî268 activasÄî en varios estados de desarrollo, que sumaban m‡s de 17 millones de art‡≠culos.",Spanish
"[5] La lista de idiomas incluye idiomas artificiales como el esperanto, lenguas ind‡≠genas o abor‡≠genes como el n‡huatl, el maya y las lenguas de las islas Andam‡n, o lenguas muertas, como el lat‡≠n, el chino cl‡sico o el anglosajÛn.",Spanish
"El 1 de marzo de 2006, la Wikipedia en inglÈs se convirtiÛ en la primera en superar el millÛn de art‡≠culos, seguida el 27 de diciembre de 2009 por la Wikipedia en alem‡n, el 21 de septiembre de 2010 por la Wikipedia en francÈs, el 17 de diciembre de 2011 por la Wikipedia en neerlandÈs, el 22 de enero de 2013 por la Wikipedia en italiano, el 11 de mayo del mismo aÒo por la Wikipedia en ruso, el 16 del mismo mes por la Wikipedia en espaÒol, el 15 de junio por la Wikipedia en sueco y el 24 de septiembre por la Wikipedia en polaco.",Spanish
"Durante la primera mitad de 2014, alcanzaron tambiÈn el millÛn de art‡≠culos tres ediciones en lenguas asi‡ticas: la Wikipedia en vietnamita, la Wikipedia en samareÒo y la Wikipedia en cebuano.",Spanish
La siguiente es una lista de las diecisÈis mayores ediciones ordenadas por n˙mero de art‡≠culos.,Spanish
"Las cifras, que son referenciadas respectivamente a cada versiÛn, son actuales.",Spanish
"Muchas ediciones de Wikipedia Äîcomo la sueca, la neerlandesa y la rusaÄî utilizan bots para la creaciÛn autom‡tica de esbozos, razÛn por la que el n˙mero de art‡≠culos no es necesariamente una referencia v‡lida con respecto a su estado o calidad.",Spanish
"[75][76] Una categorizaciÛn diferente ser‡≠a la media de tamaÒo por art‡≠culo; as‡≠, una Wikipedia con numerosos art‡≠culos de apenas unos pocos bytes quedar‡≠a situada por debajo de otra con menos entradas pero m‡s trabajadas.",Spanish
"TambiÈn hay que tener en cuenta que muchas Wikipedias Äîcomo, por ejemplo, la rusa, la japonesa, la china y la hebreaÄî usan alfabetos no latinos, silabarios o sistemas ideogr‡micos, y ello aumenta el tamaÒo de las bases de datos.",Spanish
Pa‡≠ses desde donde se editan los art‡≠culos.,Spanish
"Seg˙n estad‡≠sticas de Wikipedia, en 2020 ingresan mensualmente al sitio unos 1600 millones de dispositivos, tomando el promedio de los ˙ltimos doce meses.",Spanish
"[79] Aparte del sitio web, se han elaborado otras versiones alternativas que cumplen la misiÛn de visualizar art‡≠culos a pesar de las cr‡≠ticas a la censura de art‡≠culos.",Spanish
"En agosto de 2009, la FundaciÛn Wikimedia lanzÛ una aplicaciÛn oficial de Wikipedia para el iPhone y el iPod Touch que se puede descargar de la App Store.",Spanish
"Esta aplicaciÛn es libre, gratuita y solo funciona en el iPhone 3G o en versiones m‡s recientes.",Spanish
[80] TambiÈn hay versiÛn para Android.,Spanish
"[81] En cuanto a acceso mediante sitio web, ya exist‡≠an alternativas como el sitio Wapedia; sin embargo, Wikipedia cuenta con su propia versiÛn mÛvil del sitio, disponible en l‡≠nea.",Spanish
"Otras versiones publicadas por la FundaciÛn Wikimedia fueron las distribuciones en soporte f‡≠sico sobre CD (2003) y DVD (2005), en las cuales se inclu‡≠an las versiones en alem‡n, polaco, portuguÈs e inglÈs.",Spanish
Esto se hace mediante el software libre Kiwix que permite su instalaciÛn directa.,Spanish
"Estas caracter‡≠sticas permiten que sea posible ser usadas en computadoras sin conexiÛn a internet, permitiendo la interactividad y comunicaciÛn entre diferentes puestos como por ejemplo centros infantiles.",Spanish
[82] En Wikipedia hay servicios que ofrecen la versiÛn impresa.,Spanish
MediaWiki ha incorporado una herramienta de recolecciÛn para exportar art‡≠culos a ODF o PDF.,Spanish
"[83] TambiÈn existe la posibilidad de imprimir libros v‡≠a PediaPress, un programa socio de la fundaciÛn Wikimedia, mediante la misma solicitud.",Spanish
"[84] Desde octubre de 2005, China hab‡≠a bloqueado el acceso a Wikipedia, pues el gobierno bloquea habitualmente el acceso a los sitios web que considera subversivos y filtra las p‡ginas de Internet con tÈrminos que considera delicados.",Spanish
"[85] Un aÒo despuÈs, Wikipedia fue desbloqueada en el territorio chino, aunque la censura se mantuvo parcialmente con los tÈrminos ´sensiblesª, tales como T‡≠bet o Falun Gong.",Spanish
"[86] En 2008, varios centros educativos de los Estados Unidos prohibieron el uso de Wikipedia desde sus instalaciones por considerarla poco fiable.",Spanish
"[87] TambiÈn en el mismo aÒo, 160†000 usuarios solicitaron a travÈs del sitio web Care 2 la retirada de las im‡genes sobre Mahoma en los art‡≠culos de Wikipedia.",Spanish
En este caso la peticiÛn fue rechazada.,Spanish
"[88] En octubre de 2011, debido a la aprobaciÛn de la ley mordaza, la Wikipedia en italiano tuvo que suspender las actividades por temor a la severas multas que ejecutar‡≠an en sus contenidos biogr‡ficos.",Spanish
"[89] De manera similar, en enero de 2012, la versiÛn inglesa se autocensurÛ para protestar a la ley SOPA durante un d‡≠a entero.",Spanish
"Uno de los delegados de Twitter, Dick Costolo, considerÛ al sitio web que ´cerrar un negocio global por un solo asunto de pol‡≠tica nacional es una locuraª.",Spanish
"[90][91] La comunidad de Wikipedia es una red de voluntarios, a veces conocidos como ´wikipedistasª y a veces simplemente llamados ´usuariosª, que hacen aportaciones a la enciclopedia en l‡≠nea Wikipedia.",Spanish
Existe una jerarqu‡≠a por la que ciertos editores son elegidos para tener mayor control editorial de los miembros de la comunidad.,Spanish
"Emigh y Herring sostienen que ´unos pocos usuarios activos, cuando act˙an en concierto con las normas establecidas dentro de un sistema de ediciÛn abierta, pueden alcanzar el m‡ximo control sobre el contenido producido dentro del sistema, literalmente borrando la diversidad, la controversia y la inconsistencia, y homogeneizando las voces de los contribuyentesª.",Spanish
[92] La comunidad tambiÈn ha sido criticada por responder a las quejas sobre la calidad de un art‡≠culo aconsejando a las personas que se quejan a arreglar el art‡≠culo por s‡≠ mismos.,Spanish
"[93] El profesor James H. Fetzer ha criticado a Wikipedia en que no pod‡≠a cambiar el art‡≠culo sobre s‡≠ mismo;[94] para garantizar la imparcialidad, la Wikipedia tiene una pol‡≠tica que desalienta la ediciÛn de biograf‡≠as de los sujetos mismos salvo en ""casos claros"", como revertir el vandalismo o correcciones sobre desactualizaciÛn o datos errÛneos.",Spanish
"[95] La comunidad ha sido descrita como ""de culto"",[96][97][98] aunque no siempre con connotaciones negativas del todo.",Spanish
[99] Wikipedia no requiere que sus usuarios se identifiquen.,Spanish
"Esto significa que varias personas pueden utilizar una cuenta o, m‡s frecuentemente, una persona puede utilizar varias cuentas, a menudo en un intento de influir en el contenido de los art‡≠culos, o ayudar a crear consenso en las disputas editoriales.",Spanish
"[100][101] La ˙ltima pr‡ctica se conoce como ""usuarios t‡≠teres"", que se desalienta activamente en la Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[102] Proyectos como Wikipedia, Susning.nu o la Enciclopedia Libre son wikis en los que los art‡≠culos son desarrollados por numerosos autores, y no existe un criterio de revisiÛn formal.",Spanish
Wikipedia es la enciclopedia m‡s grande en cuanto a n˙mero de art‡≠culos o palabras jam‡s escrita.,Spanish
"Al contrario de lo que sucede con muchas otras, su contenido est‡ liberado bajo licencias de contenido abierto.",Spanish
"En el caso de Wikipedia en espaÒol, cualquier persona tiene la posibilidad de crear un art‡≠culo nuevo y casi cualquier visitante puede editar el contenido, a excepciÛn de los art‡≠culos que se encuentran protegidos.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, en la inglesa los usuarios no registrados no pueden comenzar art‡≠culos desde cero.",Spanish
"Wikipedia fue creada con la idea de producir textos de calidad a partir de la colaboraciÛn entre usuarios, a semejanza de los proyectos de desarrollo de aplicaciones libres.",Spanish
"Los art‡≠culos evolucionan con el paso del tiempo, y esto es visible en su historial de ediciones.",Spanish
"Habitualmente, una parte de las ediciones son vand‡licas Äîde contenido no relacionado con Wikipedia o con informaciÛn falsaÄî, y en ocasiones editores con puntos de vista encontrados producen lo que se conoce como guerra de ediciones.",Spanish
Esta se produce cuando dos o m‡s editores entran en un ciclo de reversiones mutuas debido a disputas causadas por diferencias de opiniÛn sobre el contenido del art‡≠culo.,Spanish
"No hay que confundir vandalismo Äîque frecuentemente afecta una sola vez a un art‡≠culo o art‡≠culosÄî con guerra de ediciones, la cual afecta repetidas veces a un mismo art‡≠culo en un breve lapso.",Spanish
"Entre los art‡≠culos vandalizados frecuentemente en la ediciÛn en espaÒol destacan: George W. Bush, Benedicto XVI o Testigos de Jehov‡; mientras que art‡≠culos con fuertes guerras de ediciones son Cuba o Comunidad Valenciana, debido a la disparidad entre las opiniones de sus redactores.",Spanish
"Cada cap‡≠tulo de Wikipedia cuenta con un grupo de personal, encargado en la cooperaciÛn.",Spanish
"Dentro de esta lista se mencionan a administradores, cuyas funciones fundamentales son hacer mantenimiento Äîtal como borrar art‡≠culos, bloquear v‡ndalos y otras funcionesÄî y estar al servicio del cumplimiento de las normas que la rigen.",Spanish
"El cap‡≠tulo con m‡s administradores es la Wikipedia en inglÈs, con un total de m‡s de 1600.",Spanish
"[104] Debido a su considerable popularidad, existieron propuestas de mascotas que representaban a Wikipedia de una manera no oficial.",Spanish
"La primera en aparecer fue la de Wik‡≠pedo, una hormiga trabajadora dedicada al mantenimiento de sus contribuciones.",Spanish
[105] Su popularidad fue poca.,Spanish
"En 2004, en una votaciÛn para ser remplazada o abandonada, la comunidad eligiÛ a Wikipe-tan, un personaje tipo OS-tan dibujada por un usuario diseÒador gr‡fico para un proyecto de anime y manga.",Spanish
"[106] No obstante, ha sido criticada por ser sexuada, considerado ofensivo por partes de la comunidad.",Spanish
"[107][108][109] Wikipedia tiene una serie de pol‡≠ticas establecidas por los propios participantes, cuya finalidad conjunta es mantener la identidad del proyecto como enciclopedia y promover la calidad de sus contenidos.",Spanish
"Cada cap‡≠tulo de Wikipedia adopta sus propias pol‡≠ticas, aunque algunas son comunes a todos ellos.",Spanish
"Una vez que la comunidad logra el consenso sobre la aplicaciÛn de una norma, todos los editores est‡n obligados a respetarla.",Spanish
Algunas de estas pol‡≠ticas son: Wikipedia es un proyecto dirigido a ÄîliteralmenteÄî todo el mundo y editable por ÄîliteralmenteÄî cualquier persona.,Spanish
"Esta caracter‡≠stica constituye una de sus mayores ventajas, pero tambiÈn genera un problema: existen personas que introducen Äîdeliberadamente o noÄî informaciÛn parcial, bien creando un planteamiento sesgado, o bien omitiendo puntos de vista que no comparten o que no les interesan.",Spanish
"[110] La pol‡≠tica que se encarga de combatir dicho problema es el punto de vista neutral, que, b‡sicamente, establece la necesidad absoluta e innegociable de reunir en los art‡≠culos susceptibles de polÈmica todos los puntos de vista significativos.",Spanish
"Adem‡s, las licencias de contenido libre garantizan que dicho contenido pueda ser reeditado cuantas veces sea necesario y por cualquier persona si el propÛsito de la ediciÛn es la mejora.",Spanish
"Seg˙n Jimmy Wales, uno de los fundadores de Wikipedia, la colaboraciÛn produce efectos positivos y ampliamente aceptados.",Spanish
"[111] Para el ingeniero inform‡tico formado en filosof‡≠a Joaqu‡≠n Siabra Fraile, Wikipedia es primero un conjunto de reglas y procedimientos y, solo despuÈs, contenidos, las reglas son un mecanismo virtual diseÒado para conseguir unos contenidos fruto del consenso racional.",Spanish
"Para Siabra se dan en el wikipedista lo que Habermas consideraba como criterios del participante en una situaciÛn ideal de comunicaciÛn: verdad, rectitud y veracidad.",Spanish
"[112][113] Wikipedia, debido a su condiciÛn de enciclopedia electrÛnica sin ‡nimo de lucro y en crecimiento permanente tanto en lo referente a su contenido como a su n˙mero de editores Äîcuya inmensa mayor‡≠a colabora de forma altruistaÄî, admite informaciÛn que no tendr‡≠a cabida en una enciclopedia convencional, limitada esta ˙ltima por el espacio f‡≠sico Äîn˙mero de tomosÄî en el que se confina dicha informaciÛn, por el n˙mero de editores contratados por la editorial y por el tiempo dedicado a confeccionar la obra.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, no toda la informaciÛn tiene cabida, y existen criterios de relevancia establecidos por consenso comunitario, de tal modo que, aunque no se rechaza a priori ning˙n art‡≠culo, se investigan las nuevas creaciones y se descartan las que no cumplen determinados requisitos.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, no se admiten los art‡≠culos autopromocionales; esto es, que ninguna persona puede publicar un art‡≠culo sobre s‡≠ misma, sobre una persona cercana Äîfamiliar, por ejemploÄî o sobre la empresa en la que trabaja.",Spanish
"Cuando el tema goza de una m‡≠nima Äîy necesariaÄî relevancia, llega a captar la atenciÛn de Äîcuando menosÄî alg˙n medio de comunicaciÛn Äîlibro, revista, periÛdicoÄî reputado, y es a estos ˙ltimos a los que, seg˙n las normas de Wikipedia, debe acudirse para crear el art‡≠culo.",Spanish
"Estos criterios est‡n contemplados en varias pol‡≠ticas, a saber, ´P‡ginas de autopromociÛnª,[114] ´Criterios para el borrado r‡pidoª,[115] ´Wikipedia no es una fuente primariaª,[116] ´Verificabilidadª[117] y ´Fuentes fiablesª.",Spanish

"[121] Sin embargo, se hab‡≠a estado trabajando en el cambio a licencias Creative Commons, porque la GFDL, inicialmente diseÒada para manuales de software, no es adecuada para trabajos de referencia en l‡≠nea y porque las dos licencias son incompatibles.",Spanish
"[122] A cada autor, editor o ilustrador que contribuye a la enciclopedia siempre se le atribuyen los derechos de autor seg˙n la convenciÛn de Berna.",Spanish
"[123] Un autor tambiÈn puede copiar contenido de otro con el permiso correspondiente Äîsobre todo en el caso de contenido con licencia libreÄî, sin embargo no podr‡ usarse un contenido que proh‡≠be su distribuciÛn, reproducciÛn o modificaciÛn de una manera il‡≠cita, porque ello limitar‡≠a su utilizaciÛn con seguridad y acarrear‡≠a problemas con las pol‡≠ticas.",Spanish
"Por ello, en la Wikipedia en inglÈs puede aparecer cualquier imagen ilustrativa siempre que lo haga de manera l‡≠cita.",Spanish
"[124] A excepciÛn del contenido y varias de sus caracter‡≠sticas, el isologo de esta marca corporativa est‡ protegido, por lo que no se permite su distribuciÛn sin previa autorizaciÛn.",Spanish
"[125] Para la fundaciÛn, la privacidad de la informaciÛn es tan importante como la prevenciÛn de vandalismo.",Spanish
"[126] Muchos art‡≠culos son revertidos o incluso ocultados del historial Äîen la imagenÄî, este ˙ltimo se consigue con la eliminaciÛn de informaciÛn a travÈs de supresores que disponen de herramientas espec‡≠ficas para ello.",Spanish
"De este modo, por ejemplo, se eliminan las ediciones insultantes o intimidatorias y se evitan sobrecargas confusas en el historial del art‡≠culo.",Spanish
"[127] En cuanto a la comunidad, los usuarios no ceden demasiada informaciÛn y es la propia comunidad quien decide salvar f‡cilmente de cualquier amenaza.",Spanish
[128] Ello permite atribuir de una manera ´anÛnimaª y minimiza el trabajo.,Spanish
"Para administrar, por ejemplo, se realizan estad‡≠sticas, para organizar las visitas, art‡≠culos, entre otros; pudiendo ser poco usual para censar comunidades.",Spanish
"En cuanto a la atribuciÛn, Creative Commons, por su parte, no garantiza el contenido por los derechos de imagen que hayan cedido.",Spanish
[129] En la Wikipedia en alem‡n los art‡≠culos no son publicados hasta haber sido revisados por un editor experto.,Spanish
Se est‡ barajando la posibilidad de aplicar la misma medida en la Wikipedia en inglÈs.,Spanish
[130] Wikipedia est‡ siendo editada por miles de personas en todo el mundo.,Spanish
"Con excepciÛn de ciertas personas remuneradas por la FundaciÛn Wikimedia,[131] el resto, conocidos en la jerga de Wikipedia como wikipedistas, act˙an siempre de manera gratuita y voluntaria.",Spanish
"[132] En total, la comunidad est‡ conformada por m‡s de 400 millones de usuarios registrados en todo el mundo,[133] incluyendo algo m‡s de 1†700†000 en la versiÛn hispana, donde el 13†% son mujeres.",Spanish
"[134] En las p‡ginas internas de Wikipedia Äîdirigidas fundamentalmente a los colaboradoresÄî, se anima a los usuarios a participar activamente en el proyecto.",Spanish
"Hay diversas formas de colaborar: desde crear nuevos art‡≠culos, ampliar los ya existentes, o corregir textos que no cumplan las convenciones de estilo establecidas o cuya informaciÛn sea errÛnea o inexacta, hasta clasificar art‡≠culos por materia, aÒadir im‡genes y otros materiales multimedia del repositorio Commons, retirar textos con derechos de autor, aportar sugerencias, o, para los m‡s inexpertos, seÒalar simplemente cualquier defecto encontrado con la finalidad de que otros lo corrijan.",Spanish
"Actualmente, 67 son administradores humanos y 31 son sistemas de mantenimiento robot como ´trabajadores autom‡ticosª de mantenimiento.",Spanish
Para colaborar no es necesario registrarse.,Spanish
"Por ese motivo, los contribuyentes que no se registran, conocidos como usuarios anÛnimos, aparecen identificados en sus ediciones con un n˙mero de IP en lugar de con un alias.",Spanish
"Por no estar registrados, tienen restringidas ciertas acciones, como la de votar en la toma de decisiones.",Spanish
En Wikipedia el registro es gratuito e instant‡neo.,Spanish
"El usuario registrado, a diferencia del anÛnimo, se identifica con un alias y una p‡gina de usuario propia,[nota 8] adem‡s de poder personalizar su interfaz de ediciÛn wiki.",Spanish
Una condiciÛn necesaria a la hora de registrarse es elegir un alias que no resulte ofensivo o dif‡≠cil de escribir.,Spanish
[135] A algunos usuarios que ya llevan un cierto tiempo editando en Wikipedia sin problemas se les asigna la categor‡≠a de autoconfirmados; sus ediciones aparecen en la p‡gina de cambios recientes con un fondo diferente al del resto de los usuarios.,Spanish
"Es una medida de econom‡≠a de esfuerzos que permite que los usuarios que se dedican a combatir vandalismo y revertir ediciones incorrectas, bas‡ndose en la confianza en estos usuarios, se abstengan de comprobar sus ediciones y de este modo focalicen su labor en el resto de las ediciones, disminuyendo el volumen de trabajo con menor riesgo de equivocarse.",Spanish
"Al d‡≠a de hoy, en la ediciÛn en espaÒol hay registrados 6†103†100 usuarios, de los cuales menos del 0,3†% son usuarios activos Äîusuarios que han realizado al menos una acciÛn en los ˙ltimos 30 d‡≠asÄî.",Spanish
"De acuerdo a Christian Stegbauer, un sociÛlogo alem‡n, ´por el n˙mero de colaboradores no puede definirse si Wikipedia es democr‡tica o noª.",Spanish
"En sus propias palabras, y refiriÈndose a la Wikipedia en alem‡n: ´nuestra conclusiÛn es que en el fondo son menos de 1000 personas las que deciden sobre esta enciclopedia digitalª.",Spanish
"[136] Se ha comprobado que determinados usuarios crean las llamadas cuentas de propÛsito particular; estos usuarios se registran con el ˙nico propÛsito de introducir informaciÛn que beneficie sus propios intereses, motivo por el cual en numerosas ocasiones sus ediciones son sesgadas, parciales o in˙tiles desde el punto de vista enciclopÈdico.",Spanish
"[135] Seg˙n un an‡lisis publicado el 1 de abril de 2009 por el investigador espaÒol JosÈ Felipe Ortega, del grupo Libresoft, de la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Wikipedia hab‡≠a sufrido ´un descenso notable de editoresª en todas sus versiones ling¸‡≠sticas entre 2007 y 2009.",Spanish
La noticia fue ampliamente recogida por los medios de comunicaciÛn.,Spanish
"[137] Esta ˙ltima afirmaciÛn fue desmentida por Jimmy Wales, fundador de Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[138] Una pequeÒa parte de los usuarios de Wikipedia Äîalrededor del 0,5†% de los usuarios activos y del 1,1 o/oooo del total de usuarios registrados en la Wikipedia en espaÒolÄî[139] se dedica a labores administrativas.",Spanish
"Estos usuarios ejercen esas funciones Äîtras ser propuestos por parte de otro u otros usuarios, generalmente veteranosÄî en una votaciÛn democr‡tica abierta a la totalidad de la comunidad de usuarios registrados, y los requisitos y normas de dicha votaciÛn Äîy de cualquier votaciÛn en generalÄî se recogen en una pol‡≠tica llamada ´Votacionesª.",Spanish
"[140] Seg˙n el sociÛlogo alem‡n Christian Stegbauer, ´[l]o interesante es que los administradores son elegidos, y as‡≠ obtienen una especie de legitimidad democr‡tica.",Spanish
"Por otro lado, solo una parte de las personas participa activamente en dicha elecciÛn, y muchos de ellos ya son administradores.",Spanish
"Si es un administrador el que propone a un candidato, la probabilidad de ser elegido es mayor que si la propuesta proviene de otro miembroª.",Spanish
"[141] La FundaciÛn Wikimedia describe los siguientes cargos administrativos principales, innecesarios para editar, pero s‡≠ necesarios para asuntos de protecciÛn y coordinaciÛn en el software:[142] Seg˙n declaraciones oficiosas de un bibliotecario colombiano de la Wikipedia en espaÒol, existe un problema de comunicaciÛn entre los bibliotecarios de esta Wikipedia en el ejercicio de las pol‡≠ticas y algunas personas que se consideran expertas en determinados temas, y este problema redunda en perjuicio para la enciclopedia.",Spanish
TambiÈn afirma que los bibliotecarios de la Wikipedia en espaÒol eliminan m‡s art‡≠culos que los de otras versiones de Wikipedia.,Spanish
"[143] En cualquier caso, las declaraciones de los usuarios de Wikipedia, ostenten cargo administrativo o no, deben tomarse como una mera opiniÛn personal sin la menor representatividad, puesto que, si bien los bibliotecarios son elegidos democr‡ticamente por el resto de los usuarios, entre sus funciones no se encuentran las de representar a la comunidad o a Wikipedia ni la de establecer autoridad m‡s all‡ de la que les confiera el ejercicio de las pol‡≠ticas.",Spanish
[144] Regularmente operan en Wikipedia varios sistemas de ediciÛn autom‡tica.,Spanish
"Se denominan bots ÄîcontracciÛn de robotÄî, y cumplen la realizaciÛn de ciertas tareas tediosas para los editores, como la creaciÛn de enlaces entre las distintas ediciones de la enciclopedia, pequeÒos ajustes internos del cÛdigo wiki, la correcciÛn de faltas ortogr‡ficas, etc.",Spanish
"Algunas ediciones de Wikipedia utilizan tambiÈn bots para la creaciÛn masiva de art‡≠culos, normalmente esbozos.",Spanish
"Para ser considerados como tales deben tener al menos el afijo BOT y un supervisor, el cual es el usuario propietario.",Spanish
[145] Wikipedia se ejecuta sobre el software libre MediaWiki.,Spanish
"MediaWiki es la fase III del programa, cuya historia de desarrollo es la siguiente: Se instalan varias extensiones de MediaWiki para ampliar la funcionalidad del software MediaWiki.",Spanish
"En julio de 2013, despuÈs de extensas pruebas beta, la extensiÛn WYSIWYG del editor visual se abriÛ al uso p˙blico.",Spanish
[146][147][148][149] La caracter‡≠stica se cambiÛ a predeterminada despuÈs.,Spanish
Wikipedia actualmente se ejecuta en grupos dedicados de servidores Linux (principalmente Ubuntu).,Spanish
"[150][151] A diciembre de 2009, hab‡≠a 300 en Florida y 44 en ‡Åmsterdam.",Spanish
"[152] Para el 22 de enero de 2013, Wikipedia hab‡≠a migrado su centro de datos primario a una instalaciÛn de Equinix en Ashburn, Virginia.",Spanish
"[153][154] En 2017, Wikipedia hab‡≠a instalado un cl˙ster de almacenamiento en cachÈ en una instalaciÛn de Equinix en Singapur, la primera de su tipo en Asia.",Spanish
"[155] Nota: No debe confundirse Wikipedia con la FundaciÛn Wikimedia, la organizaciÛn no gubernamental que mantiene al sitio web Wikipedia.",Spanish
"El sitio web de Wikipedia est‡ mantenido exclusivamente por la FundaciÛn Wikimedia, una organizaciÛn sin ‡nimo de lucro instituida bajo las leyes de Florida (Estados Unidos) cuya finalidad es promover en el mundo apoyo econÛmico y social para varios proyectos colaborativos de contenido libre.",Spanish
"[156][157] Su existencia fue oficialmente anunciada por el director general de Bomis y cofundador de Wikipedia, Jimbo Wales, el 20 de junio de 2003.",Spanish
"Dos de los proyectos de la FundaciÛn Wikimedia act˙an como complementos del resto de los proyectos, incluyendo a Wikipedia.",Spanish
"Uno es un almacÈn de contenido multimedia que los editores del resto de los proyectos pueden incrustar a modo de ilustraciones, y el otro se encarga del software que sustenta a todos los proyectos:[158] Hay contenidos que no tienen cabida en Wikipedia por no ser informaciÛn enciclopÈdica.",Spanish
Por ello se han desarrollado varios proyectos hermanos independientes entre s‡≠ que recogen este otro tipo de informaciÛn.,Spanish
Todos ellos son tambiÈn multiling¸es y libres y est‡n administrados por la FundaciÛn Wikimedia.,Spanish
"[159] Wikipedia es uno de los sitios web m‡s visitados y referenciados del mundo en Internet, y consecuentemente es uno de los primeros sitios Äîo incluso el primero, en muchos casosÄî de entre los que aparecen en los resultados de los motores de b˙squeda.",Spanish
"[11][160] Este hecho, sumado a la influencia cada vez mayor de Internet sobre las personas, trae como consecuencia un enorme impacto popular de la enciclopedia colaborativa a todos los niveles, impacto que se va acrecentando a medida que pasa el tiempo.",Spanish
"[161][161] En los ˙ltimos aÒos, Wikipedia ha estado influyendo notablemente en los medios de comunicaciÛn, sobre todo period‡≠sticos, los cuales en numerosas ocasiones copiaron informaciÛn de la web enciclopÈdica, la mayor‡≠a de las veces sin citar la fuente.",Spanish
"[162] A este respecto, es bastante ilustrativo el experimento realizado por Shane Fitzerald, un estudiante universitario dublinÈs de 22 aÒos, publicado el 6 de mayo de 2009 por el periÛdico IrishTimes.com:[163][164] Tras enterarse del fallecimiento de Maurice Jarre unas horas antes, Shane editÛ el art‡≠culo correspondiente al compositor para incluir una cita ficticia: Poco despuÈs la cita apareciÛ en las secciones necrolÛgicas de los periÛdicos The Guardian y The London Independent, en el sitio web The BBC Music Magazine y en periÛdicos de la India y Australia.",Spanish
Este experimento demuestra la fuerza de Internet a escala global.,Spanish
"Los periodistas que usaron esta cita obviamente confiaron en Wikipedia como fuente de informaciÛn; tal vez no pod‡≠an permitirse el lujo de realizar investigaciones ulteriores bajo la presiÛn de la necesidad de ser los primeros en publicar la cita, y como resultado proporcionaron a los lectores una informaciÛn falsa.",Spanish
"En cuanto a Wikipedia, los errores normalmente se corrigen con prontitud, aunque, en casos como el relatado, no lo suficiente como para adelantarse a los acontecimientos.",Spanish
"Este tipo de experimentos raramente se realizan en Wikipedia, y los editores que son descubiertos reciben por parte de los administradores severos castigos que, en funciÛn de la gravedad de su falta, pueden llegar al bloqueo de su direcciÛn IP a perpetuidad.",Spanish
"Por otra parte, existen personas que acusan a Wikipedia de difamaciÛn, y es ilustrativo el caso de Alejandro PeÒa Esclusa, quien afirmaba que el gobierno de su pa‡≠s estaba llevando contra Èl una campaÒa en la que colaborÛ la enciclopedia.",Spanish
"[165] En cualquier caso, Wikipedia, como proyecto de fuente no primaria que es, se basa en una serie de pol‡≠ticas que promueven la verificabilidad y el uso de fuentes fidedignas y reputadas.",Spanish
"A partir de este punto, Wikipedia delega cualquier tipo de responsabilidad en el momento en que publica el nombre de la fuente de la que se obtuvo la informaciÛn.",Spanish
"De ah‡≠, entre otras cosas, la importancia de la verificabilidad, uno de los cinco pilares b‡sicos sobre los que se sustenta el proyecto.",Spanish
"[166] Se han producido varios casos en los que dirigentes pol‡≠ticos, o personas prÛximas a ellos, modificaron art‡≠culos de Wikipedia interesadamente.",Spanish
"[167][168] En otro orden de cosas, se han creado versiones que la parodian.",Spanish
"Entre las m‡s conocidas se encuentran, en inglÈs, Uncyclopedia y Encyclop‡¶dia Dramatica, y, en espaÒol, La Frikipedia e Inciclopedia.",Spanish
"En historietas humor‡≠sticas, Skeletor aparece vandalizando el art‡≠culo de He-Man.",Spanish
"[169] Debido a sus mÈritos y popularidad, el sitio web ha obtenido a lo largo de los aÒos varios galardones y menciones.",Spanish
[171] Algunas muestras son las siguientes: Los usuarios de Wikipedia organizan eventos regulares y ocasionales con el objetivo de promover la creaciÛn y ediciÛn de art‡≠culos.,Spanish
"Por ejemplo, en 2006 se creÛ un proyecto llamado Wiki-reto: 250†k, dedicado a aumentar el n˙mero de art‡≠culos, con el que se llegÛ al final del aÒo a los 250†000 art‡≠culos en la Wikipedia en espaÒol.",Spanish
[184] Proyectos de ese tipo o similares se organizan cada aÒo.,Spanish
"Por otro lado, existe una serie de proyectos incluidos en el propio sitio web que reciben el nombre de wikiproyectos, cada uno de los cuales se dedica a trabajar sobre un tema espec‡≠fico Äîcorrecciones ortogr‡ficas, creaciÛn y ampliaciÛn de art‡≠culos de determinado campo, manejo de ilustraciones, etc.",Spanish
"[185] Fuera del sitio web, otros han expresado las impresiones personales que el sitio les produce.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, Vicente Verd˙, en un art‡≠culo de la versiÛn digital del periÛdico El Pa‡≠s, describiÛ la experiencia de usar Wikipedia como ´una divertida y multitudinaria manera de gozar, jugar, amar y pasar el ratoª.",Spanish
"[186] Por su parte, en un art‡≠culo de opiniÛn en Terra Networks Per˙ se consideraba que su uso desordenado y excesivo causaba ´wiki adicciÛnª.",Spanish
"[187] En una entrevista con Jimmy Wales, representante de la FundaciÛn Wikimedia, para EFE, este explicÛ su creencia de que la expansiÛn de Internet en otros pa‡≠ses ampliar‡≠a el uso de Wikipedia sobre todo en lugares subdesarrollados, creando de este modo una conexiÛn de culturas.",Spanish
"[188] Con motivo del dÈcimo aniversario de Wikipedia, el mismo Wales declarÛ su deseo de que Wikipedia alcanzase los 1000 millones de usuarios para 2015.",Spanish
"[189] En el ‡mbito econÛmico, Alex Konanykhin, fundador y presidente de WikiExperts.us Äîno perteneciente a WikimediaÄî, presentÛ a Wales una propuesta de colaboraciÛn.",Spanish
El plan consist‡≠a en ofrecer los servicios de una red de escritores por contrato a todas las empresas o entidades que cumpliesen con los requisitos de rigor exigidos por Wikipedia para crearles sus propios art‡≠culos de forma enciclopÈdica.,Spanish
"Seg˙n Konanykhin, este modelo financiero asegurar‡≠a el futuro de Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[190] No obstante, Wikipedia, lejos de presentar apuros econÛmicos, ha batido su rÈcord de recaudaciÛn en la campaÒa efectuada para el ejercicio de 2011, con 16 millones de dÛlares procedentes de 500†000 donantes de 140 pa‡≠ses, todo ello en tan solo un mes y medio.",Spanish
"[191] La cr‡≠tica a Wikipedia ha sido dirigida hacia su contenido, sus procedimientos, el car‡cter y las pr‡cticas de la comunidad de Wikipedia, as‡≠ como su naturaleza como enciclopedia de fuentes abiertas que cualquiera puede editar.",Spanish
"Las principales preocupaciones de sus cr‡≠ticos son la fiabilidad del contenido, la escritura de su prosa, la organizaciÛn de los art‡≠culos, as‡≠ como la existencia de sesgos sistÈmicos, de gÈnero y raciales entre la comunidad editorial.",Spanish
"Wikipedia tambiÈn ha sido criticada por su manejo desigual, aceptaciÛn y retenciÛn de art‡≠culos en temas polÈmicos.",Spanish
Hay controversia sobre su fiabilidad y precisiÛn.,Spanish
[193] La revista cient‡≠fica Nature declarÛ en diciembre de 2005 que la Wikipedia en inglÈs era casi tan exacta en art‡≠culos cient‡≠ficos como la Encyclopaedia Britannica.,Spanish
[194] El estudio se realizÛ comparando 42 art‡≠culos de ambas obras por un comitÈ de expertos sin que estos supieran de cu‡l de las dos enciclopedias proven‡≠an.,Spanish
"El resultado fue que Wikipedia ten‡≠a casi el mismo nivel de precisiÛn que la Enciclopedia Brit‡nica, pero ten‡≠a un promedio de un error m‡s por art‡≠culo.",Spanish
"[195] Por otro lado, y seg˙n consta en un reportaje publicado en junio de 2009 por el periÛdico espaÒol El Pa‡≠s, un estudio de 2007, dirigido por el periodista francÈs Pierre Assouline y realizado por un grupo de alumnos del m‡ster de Periodismo del Instituto de Estudios Pol‡≠ticos de Par‡≠s para analizar la fiabilidad del proyecto, se materializÛ en el libro La revoluciÛn Wikipedia (Alianza Editorial) cuyas conclusiones eran bastante cr‡≠ticas.",Spanish
"Entre otras cosas, afirmaba que el estudio de Nature fue poco estricto y sesgado, as‡≠ como que, seg˙n su propio estudio, la Britannica continuaba siendo un 24†% m‡s fiable que la Wikipedia.",Spanish
"[196] Desde su nacimiento, Larry Sanger ya discrepÛ por la posible falta de veracidad, y le siguieron despuÈs otros autores, caso de Arias Maldonado†(2010, p.†15-31) o Assouline†et al.",Spanish
(2008).,Spanish
"Incluso los que la defienden como una obra documentada, caso de Tim O'Reilly, la colocan en los ˙ltimos puestos.",Spanish
"[197] Ndesanjo Macha indica que muchas veces lo m‡s enriquecedor est‡ en las discusiones y no en el art‡≠culo propiamente dicho, porque all‡≠ pueden reflejarse mejor los distintos puntos de vista y las lagunas existentes.",Spanish
"Para Bob McHenry, exeditor de la Enciclopedia Brit‡nica, uno de los mayores riesgos a los que se enfrenta Wikipedia es la entrada de personas convencidas de que su punto de vista es el verdadero, impidiendo incluir cualquier otro.",Spanish
"Por esta razÛn, lo realmente valioso puede aparecer en las discusiones y no el art‡≠culo, como confirma Ndesanjo Macha.",Spanish
[197] Para Assouline†et al.,Spanish
"(2008, p.†12) Wikipedia est‡ matando los valores de verificaciÛn y consulta de fuentes primarias que deben tener los periodistas, historiadores o profesionales del conocimiento en general.",Spanish
"Seg˙n el autor ""esta enciclopedia en l‡≠nea es tambiÈn el instrumento ideal para desinformar"" al ser editada por partidos pol‡≠ticos y otros grupos de presiÛn.",Spanish
"[198] Adem‡s presenta problemas en la diferenciaciÛn de lo importante y lo superfluo: as‡≠, en la versiÛn francesa, la entrada sobre Albert Londres comenzaba diciendo ´periodista jud‡≠o francÈs [...]ª como si su religiÛn fuese el segundo dato m‡s importante del resumen, incierto al mismo tiempo por ser londinense y catÛlico, fruto de una campaÒa para desacreditarlo haciÈndolo pasar por jud‡≠o.",Spanish
"Otro ejemplo era el art‡≠culo sobre Alexandre Solzhenitsyn que dedicaba la mitad de su contenido a la relaciÛn del escritor con EspaÒa, por haber realizado un comentario sobre Francisco Franco que no gustÛ al redactor.",Spanish
"[199] Los ejemplos dados por Assouline sobre la excesiva extensiÛn de unos contenidos frente a otros fueron refrendados por un estudio dirigido por la Universidad de Minnesota, junto a otras tres, en 2011.",Spanish
"La conclusiÛn fue que la Wikipedia en inglÈs mostraba que los art‡≠culos realizados por mujeres, presumiblemente destinados m‡s a un p˙blico femenino, eran significativamente m‡s cortos que los redactados por hombres o por hombres y mujeres.",Spanish
"En ese mismo aÒo la Universidad de Oxford demostrÛ que el 84†% de las referencias a localidades se situaban en Europa y AmÈrica del Norte, del mismo modo que la Ant‡rtida contaba con m‡s art‡≠culos que ‡Åfrica o SudamÈrica.",Spanish
"[200] Dos de los principales motivos por los cuales Wikipedia es criticada en cuanto a la exactitud y fiabilidad de sus contenidos son la persistencia de detalles errÛneos dif‡≠ciles de detectar Äîimprecisiones no necesariamente malintencionadas, pero que pueden permanecer en un art‡≠culo por mucho tiempoÄî.",Spanish
"[201] Por su parte los actos vand‡licos, modificaciones inapropiadas u ofensivas de los art‡≠culos que entorpecen el desarrollo del proyecto, constituyen un importante factor en las problem‡ticas de contenido, cuya soluciÛn a largo plazo no pasa Äîcomo sucede en los otros dos casosÄî por una mejora constante de la calidad ni por la incorporaciÛn o ampliaciÛn progresiva de art‡≠culos.",Spanish
"Mientras que las inexactitudes de contenido y las tendencias de crecimiento irregular[200] pueden ser subsanadas a medida que siga evolucionando el proyecto Äîy aumenten las ediciones de art‡≠culosÄî, el vandalismo representa una amenaza constante que se incrementa en proporciÛn al crecimiento exponencial de Wikipedia.",Spanish
"Por ejemplo, la exposiciÛn a una mayor afluencia de visitas a los art‡≠culos publicados en varios medios de prensa implicaba un porcentaje muy alto de vandalismos Äîincluidos de personajes p˙blicosÄî, casi tanto como el de cambios constructivos.",Spanish
"[202][203][204] Pero no solo se trata de ediciones dentro de art‡≠culo, tambiÈn existen art‡≠culos enteros falsos.",Spanish
"[nota 10] La Wikipedia en inglÈs posee una entrada dedicada solo a ellos, como tambiÈn la Wikipedia en espaÒol.",Spanish
La existencia de art‡≠culos falsos con una duraciÛn de casi diez aÒos siembra dudas sobre la capacidad de Wikipedia para autocorregirse.,Spanish
"En otros casos, adem‡s de la duraciÛn destaca los sucesivos filtros por los que pasaron, caso del Conflicto de Bicholim que fue redactado sin que nadie se percatara del fraude, propuesto a Bueno, elegido como Art‡≠culo Bueno, propuesto a Destacado y rechazado por cuestiones tÈcnicas sin que nadie comprobase la veracidad de los contenidos.",Spanish
"[205] De manera similar pasÛ con el art‡≠culo Cayo Flavio Antonino, supuesto asesino de Julio CÈsar, cuya entrada permaneciÛ ocho aÒos en forma de esbozo.",Spanish
"[206] Uno de los m‡s controversiales fue Santiago Swallow, conferencista ficticio creado por Kevin Ashton y que fue descubierto al publicarse un art‡≠culo de prensa donde el autor declarÛ que ´invirtiÛ 68 dÛlares para hacerlo famosoª.",Spanish

"[209] Un ejemplo paradigm‡tico de vandalismo masivo se produjo el 31 de julio de 2006 como consecuencia de una llamada a la participaciÛn por parte de Stephen Colbert, un conocido humorista y presentador de la televisiÛn norteamericana, en una secciÛn de su programa The Colbert Report que titulÛ Wikiality:[211] DespuÈs de algunos gags en torno a la posibilidad de cambiar la ubicaciÛn de estados y pa‡≠ses en sus respectivas definiciones de Wikipedia, animÛ a los telespectadores a modificar la entrada 'elefante' para que constara que, en lugar de disminuir, la poblaciÛn del elefante africano se hab‡≠a triplicado.",Spanish
"Como resultado inmediato, hasta veinte entradas de la Wikipedia en inglÈs que hac‡≠an referencia a elefantes fueron bloqueadas por sus administradores, o bien pasaron a estado de semi-protegidas, solo modificables por usuarios registrados con un m‡≠nimo de antig¸edad.",Spanish
"Para todos los ejemplos citados y sus variantes, aparte de las medidas correctoras llevadas a cabo en forma de reversiÛn, aviso o bloqueo, la comunidad de wikipedistas crea y mantiene Äîal igual que sucede entre programadores voluntarios en entornos de software libreÄî toda una serie de herramientas e implementaciones tÈcnicas destinadas a actuar contra el vandalismo, desde foros y canales espec‡≠ficos de IRC hasta programas paralelos de detecciÛn y aviso, pasando por usuarios que son en realidad programas bot cuya misiÛn es exclusivamente combatir los actos vand‡licos.",Spanish
"Parece que con dichas modificaciones ese problema comenzÛ a estar bajo control desde 2007, pero limitÛ las posibilidades de supervivencia de Wikipedia.",Spanish
[200] En otras ocasiones los errores llegan por la confusiÛn.,Spanish
"Algunos han confundido ´Wikipediaª con ´WikiLeaksª,[212] un sitio de almacenamiento de documentos filtrados conocido por la polÈmica del cablegate.",Spanish
"Jimmy Wales, cofundador de Wikipedia, explicÛ que, cuando en 2006 WikiLeaks comenzÛ sus actividades, se presentÛ como la 'Wikipedia de los secretos'.",Spanish
Cuando Wales fundÛ Wikipedia creÛ una organizaciÛn llamada Wikia.,Spanish
"Esta organizaciÛn se encargÛ de registrar los dominios bajo el tÈrmino Wiki, y permitiÛ a WikiLeaks en sus comienzos la utilizaciÛn del tÈrmino Wiki y su dominio correspondiente.",Spanish
"No obstante, actualmente Äîenero de 2011Äî, los dominios adquiridos por WikiLeaks est‡n a punto de caducar, y Jimmy Wales no tiene intenciÛn de renovar el contrato ya que, en sus propias palabras, no desea que Wikipedia se relacione con WikiLeaks.",Spanish
"[213] El proyecto cuenta con importantes subvenciones de multinacionales estadounidenses, de intereses capitalistas.",Spanish
"[214][215] Por otro lado, en opiniÛn de CÈsar Rendueles, doctor en filosof‡≠a, profesor asociado de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid[216] y usuario de Wikipedia, ´todo [en Wikipedia] es mucho m‡s domÈstico de lo que alguna gente se imaginaª.",Spanish
"En su opiniÛn, ´la enciclopedia est‡ ÄúcontroladaÄù por todos aquellos que generosamente dedican su tiempo regularmente a la ediciÛn de art‡≠culosª, y afirma que como resultado la enciclopedia refleja el perfil predominantemente conservador Äîaunque en muchos casos para la redacciÛn de art‡≠culos, muestra el lado liberal, dando mayor Ènfasis en la libertad de contenido que en la cooperaciÛn del mismoÄî[217][218] de quienes disponen de m‡s tiempo libre.",Spanish

"[219] OpiniÛn contraria a otros autores como Daniel Rodr‡≠guez Herrera, para quien la Wikipedia posee una clara tendencia izquierdista, lo cual se comprueba viendo los res˙menes de Stalin y otros dirigentes comunistas que no son llamados en ning˙n momento ""dictadores"", solamente l‡≠deres.",Spanish
[220] Algunas empresas han intentado en repetidas ocasiones manipular la informaciÛn que aparece sobre ellas en Wikipedia enfatizando los aspectos positivos y suavizando o eliminando los negativos con el fin de mejorar su imagen corporativa.,Spanish
"Por ejemplo, Microsoft eliminÛ un p‡rrafo donde aparec‡≠an los errores de su consola Xbox 360, y el consorcio petrol‡≠fero Chevron-Texaco borrÛ todo un texto sobre biodiÈsel.",Spanish
En 2013 el diario econÛmico ExpansiÛn denunciÛ las acciones de algunas de las principales empresas espaÒolas para manipular su historial o alterar favorablemente las biograf‡≠as de sus directivos.,Spanish
[221] Cambios de este tipo pueden ser detectados con la utilizaciÛn de una herramienta llamada WikiScanner.,Spanish
"[222] Otras cr‡≠ticas, adem‡s de en su precisiÛn, han estado refiriÈndose a la violaciÛn de la intimidad de algunas personas,[223][224] a la adiciÛn de im‡genes interpretadas como pornograf‡≠a infantil,[225][226] la escasa certeza en las entradas sobre temas de salud,[227] o a la creaciÛn de art‡≠culos biogr‡ficos sobre animales.",Spanish
Algunas denuncias llegaron a ser muy notorias y graves como el uso del escudo perteneciente a la Oficina Federal de InvestigaciÛn en uno de sus art‡≠culos.,Spanish
"[228] Un tema de controversia en ciertos medios es la labor de algunos administradores Äî´bibliotecariosªÄî, que se extralimitan en sus funciones bloqueando a otros usuarios y generando enfados, razÛn por la cual varios quieren mantener su incÛgnito por miedo a represalias.",Spanish
"[199] TambiÈn el ambiente de Wikipedia permite e incluso fomenta ese tipo de actuaciones; pues, seg˙n Arias Maldonado,[229] una de las partes divertidas de Wikipedia es conspirar.",Spanish
"Una evidencia por parte de FiveThirtyEight sobre los 100 art‡≠culos m‡s editados de la versiÛn en inglÈs muestra que los temas m‡s controvertidos para la Wikipedia son los deportes, personajes del entretenimiento norteamericano, pol‡≠tica y religiÛn.",Spanish
"En el top de la lista est‡n los art‡≠culos sobre Estados Unidos, Michael Jackson, Jesucristo y los luchadores de la WWE, el ˙ltimo mucho mayor que el art‡≠culo del Real Madrid.",Spanish
[230] Un estudio sobre el tratamiento desigual en los contenidos de la mayor enciclopedia de la web dio cuenta de que solo las grandes mujeres est‡n bien representadas en la enciclopedia y los art‡≠culos sobre ellas presentan desigualdades de gÈnero.,Spanish
"[236][237] A pesar de que cada vez m‡s personas  se informan en Wikipedia, este sitio web ha visto una baja significativa en sus visitas en el buscador Google, unos 250 millones en tres meses (abril-junio de 2015) que representa  cerca del 11†%, as‡≠ lo informÛ un estudio de Similar Web, empresa brit‡nica de tecnolog‡≠a e informaciÛn y luego corroborado por el  cofundador de Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales.",Spanish
"[239] Una de las razones  de esa brusca ca‡≠da puede ser que el buscador da una referencia directa a Wikipedia al lado derecho de la pantalla, lo que quitar‡≠a la necesidad de cliquear el enlace.",Spanish
"[240] En un informe de Hackernoon, sitio web estadunidense en publicaciÛn de tecnolog‡≠a, Wikipedia hab‡≠a perdido en 2019 +3k millones de p‡ginas vistas.",Spanish
"En enero de 2020, hab‡≠a perdido un 14% de su tr‡fico en comparaciÛn con el mismo mes de 2019.",Spanish
"El principal culpable de esta bajada es el buscador de Google, que entre sus muchas funciones y herramientas, muestra a menudo extractos de Wikipedia cuando se hace una b˙squeda y suele dar prioridad a los v‡≠deos de YouTube, plataforma de su propiedad.",Spanish
[241] Similar situaciÛn est‡ ocurriendo debido a los asistentes de Alexa y Siri.,Spanish
[242] Este sistema de b˙squedas tan de moda se llama b˙squeda sin 'clicks y hace que Wikipedia pierda visitas a gran velocidad.,Spanish
"Seg˙n Ortega Soto†(2009) las principales versiones de Wikipedia (inglesa, alemana, japonesa, espaÒola, etc) estaban perdiendo usuarios porque los nuevos editores no compensaban en n˙mero a los veteranos que abandonaban la ediciÛn.",Spanish
Adem‡s hab‡≠a disminuido el tiempo medio que un editor tardaba en desistir.,Spanish
"[243] Esta tendencia la confirmÛ en 2013 Tom Simonite, del Instituto TecnolÛgico de Massachusetts (MIT), cuando confirmaba que la propia FundaciÛn Wikimedia reconoc‡≠a que la enciclopedia en l‡≠nea ten‡≠a problemas ante la carencia cada vez m‡s acusada de voluntarios.",Spanish
"[200] En contraste, el an‡lisis de tendencias publicado en The Economist presenta a Wikipedia en otros idiomas (Wikipedia no inglesa) como exitosa en retener a sus editores activos de manera renovable y sostenida, con un n˙mero relativamente constante.",Spanish
"[244] En 2010, Alison J.",Spanish
Head y Michael B. Eisenberg publicaron una investigaciÛn sobre el uso que dan a la Wikipedia los estudiantes universitarios.,Spanish
"El estudio tuvo lugar en siete universidades de Estados Unidos, y ten‡≠a como objetivo mostrar con quÈ frecuencia, motivos y en quÈ momento de un trabajo acadÈmico, se utiliza esta enciclopedia.",Spanish
El resultado la posicionÛ como la sexta fuente de consulta y la segunda no acadÈmica; la enciclopedia predilecta para obtener un trasfondo general sobre un tema.,Spanish
"Se ubicÛ por delante de sitios gubernamentales, compaÒeros de clase, colecciones personales de libros, y la Enciclopedia Brit‡nica, que quedÛ relegada al undÈcimo puesto (61†%).",Spanish
"[245][246] Un estudio de la Universidad Carolina de 2018 concluyÛ que Wikipedia es el recursos educativo abierto m‡s utilizado por estudiantes, y argumentÛ que las instituciones educativas deber‡≠an centrar su atenciÛn en ello (por ejemplo, apoyando wikipedistas residentes).",Spanish
"[247] El aprendizaje autom‡tico o aprendizaje automatizado o aprendizaje de m‡quinas (del inglÈs, machine learning) es el subcampo de las ciencias de la computaciÛn y una rama de  la inteligencia artificial, cuyo objetivo es desarrollar tÈcnicas que permitan que las computadoras aprendan.",Spanish
"Se dice que un agente aprende cuando su desempeÒo mejora con la experiencia; es decir, cuando la habilidad no estaba presente en su genotipo o rasgos de nacimiento.",Spanish
"[1] De forma m‡s concreta, los investigadores del aprendizaje de m‡quinas buscan algoritmos y heur‡≠sticas para convertir muestras de datos en programas de computadora, sin tener que escribir los ˙ltimos expl‡≠citamente.",Spanish
Los modelos o programas resultantes deben ser capaces de generalizar comportamientos e inferencias para un conjunto m‡s amplio (potencialmente infinito) de datos.,Spanish
"En muchas ocasiones el campo de actuaciÛn del aprendizaje autom‡tico se solapa con el de la estad‡≠stica inferencial, ya que las dos disciplinas se basan en el an‡lisis de datos.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, el aprendizaje autom‡tico incorpora las preocupaciones de la complejidad computacional de los problemas[2].",Spanish
"Muchos problemas son de clase NP-hard, por lo que gran parte de la investigaciÛn realizada en aprendizaje autom‡tico est‡ enfocada al diseÒo de soluciones factibles a esos problemas.",Spanish
El aprendizaje autom‡tico tambiÈn est‡ estrechamente relacionado con el reconocimiento de patrones.,Spanish
El aprendizaje autom‡tico puede ser visto como un intento de automatizar algunas partes del mÈtodo cient‡≠fico mediante mÈtodos matem‡ticos.,Spanish
Por lo tanto es un proceso de inducciÛn del conocimiento.,Spanish
"El aprendizaje autom‡tico tiene una amplia gama de aplicaciones, incluyendo motores de b˙squeda, diagnÛsticos mÈdicos, detecciÛn de fraude en el uso de tarjetas de crÈdito, an‡lisis del mercado de valores, clasificaciÛn de secuencias de ADN, reconocimiento del habla y del lenguaje escrito, juegos y robÛtica.",Spanish
"Algunos sistemas de aprendizaje autom‡tico intentan eliminar toda necesidad de intuiciÛn o conocimiento experto de los procesos de an‡lisis de datos, mientras otros tratan de establecer un marco de colaboraciÛn entre el experto y la computadora.",Spanish
"De todas formas, la intuiciÛn humana no puede ser reemplazada en su totalidad, ya que el diseÒador del sistema ha de especificar la forma de representaciÛn de los datos y los mÈtodos de manipulaciÛn y caracterizaciÛn de los mismos.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, las computadoras son utilizadas por todo el mundo con fines tecnolÛgicos muy buenos.",Spanish
El aprendizaje autom‡tico tiene como resultado un modelo para resolver una tarea dada.,Spanish
Entre los modelos se distinguen[3] Los modelos pueden tambiÈn clasificarse como modelos de agrupamiento y modelos de gradiente.,Spanish
Los primeros tratan de dividir el espacio de instancias en grupos.,Spanish
"Los segundos, como su nombre lo indican, representan un gradiente en el que se puede diferenciar entre cada instancia.",Spanish
Clasificadores geomÈtricos como las m‡quinas de vectores de apoyo son modelos de gradientes.,Spanish
Los diferentes algoritmos de Aprendizaje Autom‡tico se agrupan en una taxonom‡≠a en funciÛn de la salida de los mismos.,Spanish
Algunos tipos de algoritmos son: El an‡lisis computacional y de rendimiento de los algoritmos de aprendizaje autom‡tico es una rama de la estad‡≠stica conocida como teor‡≠a computacional del aprendizaje.,Spanish
El aprendizaje autom‡tico las personas lo llevamos a cabo de manera autom‡tica ya que es un proceso tan sencillo para nosotros que ni nos damos cuenta de cÛmo se realiza y todo lo que implica.,Spanish
"Desde que nacemos hasta que morimos los seres humanos llevamos a cabo diferentes procesos, entre ellos encontramos el de aprendizaje por medio del cual adquirimos conocimientos, desarrollamos habilidades para analizar y evaluar a travÈs de mÈtodos y tÈcnicas as‡≠ como tambiÈn por medio de la experiencia propia.",Spanish
"Sin embargo, a las m‡quinas hay que indicarles cÛmo aprender, ya que si no se logra que una m‡quina sea capaz de desarrollar sus habilidades, el proceso de aprendizaje no se estar‡ llevando a cabo, sino que solo ser‡ una secuencia repetitiva.",Spanish
Este tipo de aprendizaje usa un ‡rbol de decisiones como modelo predictivo.,Spanish
Se mapean observaciones sobre un objeto con conclusiones sobre el valor final de dicho objeto.,Spanish
Los ‡rboles son estructuras b‡sicas en la inform‡tica.,Spanish
Los ‡rboles de atributos son la base de las decisiones.,Spanish
"Una de las dos formas principales de ‡rboles de decisiones es la desarrollada por Quinlan de medir la impureza de la entrop‡≠a en cada rama, algo que primero desarrollÛ en el algoritmo ID3 y luego en el C4.5.",Spanish
"Otra de las estrategias se basa en el ‡≠ndice GINI y fue desarrollada por Breiman, Friedman et alia.",Spanish
El algoritmo de CART es una implementaciÛn de esta estrategia.,Spanish
[5] Los algoritmos de reglas de asociaciÛn procuran descubrir relaciones interesantes entre variables.,Spanish
"Entre los mÈtodos m‡s conocidos se hallan el algoritmo a priori, el algoritmo Eclat y el algoritmo de PatrÛn Frecuente.",Spanish
Los algoritmos genÈticos son procesos de b˙squeda heur‡≠stica que simulan la selecciÛn natural.,Spanish
Usan mÈtodos tales como la mutaciÛn y el cruzamiento para generar nuevas clases que puedan ofrecer una buena soluciÛn a un problema dado.,Spanish
Las redes de neuronas artificiales (RNA) son un paradigma de aprendizaje autom‡tico inspirado en las neuronas de los sistemas nerviosos de los animales.,Spanish
Se trata de un sistema de enlaces de neuronas que colaboran entre s‡≠ para producir un est‡≠mulo de salida.,Spanish
Las conexiones tienen pesos numÈricos que se adaptan seg˙n la experiencia.,Spanish
"De esta manera, las redes neurales se adaptan a un impulso y son capaces de aprender.",Spanish
"La importancia de las redes neurales cayÛ durante un tiempo con el desarrollo de los vectores de soporte y clasificadores lineales, pero volviÛ a surgir a finales de la dÈcada de 2000 con la llegada del aprendizaje profundo.",Spanish
Las MVS son una serie de mÈtodos de aprendizaje supervisado usados para clasificaciÛn y regresiÛn.,Spanish
Los algoritmos de MVS usan un conjunto de ejemplos de entrenamiento clasificado en dos categor‡≠as para construir un modelo que prediga si un nuevo ejemplo pertenece a una u otra de dichas categor‡≠as.,Spanish
El an‡lisis por agrupamiento (clustering en inglÈs) es la clasificaciÛn de observaciones en subgrupos ÄîclustersÄî para que las observaciones en cada grupo se asemejen entre s‡≠ seg˙n ciertos criterios.,Spanish
Las tÈcnicas de agrupamiento hacen inferencias diferentes sobre la estructura de los datos; se gu‡≠an usualmente por una medida de similitud espec‡≠fica y por un nivel de compactamiento interno (similitud entre los miembros de un grupo) y la separaciÛn entre los diferentes grupos.,Spanish
El agrupamiento es un mÈtodo de aprendizaje no supervisado y es una tÈcnica muy popular de an‡lisis estad‡≠stico de datos.,Spanish
"Una red bayesiana, red de creencia o modelo ac‡≠clico dirigido es un modelo probabil‡≠stico que representa una serie de variables de azar y sus independencias condicionales a travÈs de un grafo ac‡≠clico dirigido.",Spanish
"Una red bayesiana puede representar, por ejemplo, las relaciones probabil‡≠sticas entre enfermedades y s‡≠ntomas.",Spanish
"Dados ciertos s‡≠ntomas, la red puede usarse para calcular las probabilidades de que ciertas enfermedades estÈn presentes en un organismo.",Spanish
Hay algoritmos eficientes que infieren y aprenden usando este tipo de representaciÛn.,Spanish
"En el aprendizaje autom‡tico podemos obtener 3 tipos de conocimiento, que son: Los tres tipos se efect˙an durante un proceso de aprendizaje autom‡tico pero la importancia de cada tipo de conocimiento depende de las caracter‡≠sticas de lo que se est‡ tratando de aprender.",Spanish
"El aprendizaje es m‡s que una necesidad, es un factor primordial para satisfacer las necesidades de la inteligencia artificial.",Spanish
El aprendizaje supervisado se caracteriza por contar con informaciÛn que especifica quÈ conjuntos de datos son satisfactorios para el objetivo del aprendizaje.,Spanish
"Un ejemplo podr‡≠a ser un software que reconoce si una imagen dada es o no la imagen de un rostro: para el aprendizaje del programa tendr‡≠amos que proporcionarle diferentes im‡genes, especificando en el proceso si se trata o no de rostros.",Spanish
"En el aprendizaje no supervisado, en cambio, el programa no cuenta con datos que definan quÈ informaciÛn es satisfactoria o no.",Spanish
"El objetivo principal de estos programas suele ser encontrar patrones que permitan separar y clasificar los datos en diferentes grupos, en funciÛn de sus atributos.",Spanish
"Siguiendo el ejemplo anterior un software de aprendizaje no supervisado no ser‡≠a capaz de decirnos si una imagen dada es un rostro o no pero s‡≠ podr‡≠a, por ejemplo, clasificar las im‡genes entre aquellas que contienen rostros humanos, de animales, o las que no contienen.",Spanish
La informaciÛn obtenida por un algoritmo de aprendizaje no supervisado debe ser posteriormente interpretada por una persona para darle utilidad.,Spanish
A continuaciÛn se muestran una serie de temas que podr‡≠an formar parte del temario de un curso sobre aprendizaje autom‡tico.,Spanish
El aprendizaje autom‡tico naciÛ de la b˙squeda de inteligencia artificial.,Spanish
"Ya en los primeros d‡≠as de la IA como disciplina acadÈmica, algunos investigadores se interesaron en hacer que las m‡quinas aprendiesen.",Spanish
"Trataron de resolver el problema con diversos mÈtodos simbÛlicos, as‡≠ como lo que ellos llamaron 'redes neurales' que eran en general perceptrones y otros modelos b‡sicamente basados en modelos lineares generalizados como se conocen en las estad‡≠sticas.",Spanish
Muchos lenguajes de programaciÛn pueden usarse para implementar algoritmos de aprendizaje autom‡tico.,Spanish
Los m‡s populares para 2015 eran R y Python.,Spanish
"[6] R es muy usado ante todo en el campo acadÈmico, mientras que Python es m‡s popular en la empresa privada.",Spanish
"Entre los paquetes de software que incluyen algoritmos de aprendizaje automatizado, se hallan los siguientes:  Los algoritmos de aprendizaje autom‡tico a menudo pueden verse afectados por el sesgo que puedan tener los datos (Ver sesgo algoritmico).",Spanish
Por ejemplo no se podr‡n clasificar todos aquellas entradas de las que no se haya recibido ninguna informaciÛn en la fase de entrenamiento.,Spanish
De hecho cuando el entrenamiento se realiza con datos clasificados por el ser humano el aprendizaje autom‡tico tiende a crear los mismos segos que hay en la sociedad.,Spanish
"Algunos ejemplos de esto son cuando en 2015 el algoritmo de Google photos identificaba algunas personas negras con gorilas, o en 2016 cuando el bot de Twitter de Microsoft desarrollo comportamientos racistas y machistas a base de observar el tr‡fico de datos en dicha red social.",Spanish
"Por este motivo en los ˙ltimos aÒos ha habido una tendencia a desarrollar mÈtodos para aumentar la equidad, es decir, para reducir el sesgo en este tipo algoritmos por parte de los expertos en IA.",Spanish
"Citando a Fei-fei Li ""La IA no tiene nada de especial.",Spanish
"Se inspira en personas, es creada por personas, y lo m‡s importante impacta en las personas.",Spanish
"Es una herramienta muy poderosa que tan solo hemos comenzado a entender, y esa es una gran responsabilidad"" [7]

"hay demasiado en mi plato, me estoy ahogando en el trabajo.",Spanish
"Estoy inundado de asignaciones, la palabra inteligente n˙mero dos es catch-22 ahora estoy seguro de que t˙ ' He escuchado esta palabra antes de catch-22 significa una situaciÛn imposible en la que no puedes hacer una cosa a menos que hayas hecho la otra y no puedas hacer la otra porque no has hecho lo primero.",Spanish
"Te confund‡≠, as‡≠ que dÈjame darte algunos ejemplos.",Spanish
Una situaciÛn sin sentido es cuando no consigues un trabajo sin tener experiencia laboral.,Spanish
pero no se puede adquirir experiencia hasta que consigues un trabajo.,Spanish
El catch-22 fue acuÒado por joseph heller en su famoso libro del mismo nombre catch-22 cuando describ‡≠a algunas reglas contradictorias que eran aplicables a los soldados durante la segunda guerra mundial.,Spanish
Otro ejemplo de catch-22 es que necesita un prÈstamo bancario porque no tiene suficiente.,Spanish
"dinero, pero no obtendr‡≠a ese prÈstamo bancario a menos que le demuestre al banco que tiene suficiente dinero, as‡≠ que la prÛxima vez que se encuentre atrapado en una situaciÛn dif‡≠cil, recuerde.",Spanish

Otras palabras que puedes usar en lugar de catch-22 son paradojas o dilemas.,Spanish
"el n˙mero tres es afable afable afable significa ser sofisticado para ser educado, sereno, fresco y. Bien educado, la palabra suave tiene varios or‡≠genes diferentes, pero un origen muy interesante de la palabra es que significa ejemplo de sabor agradable o dulce.",Spanish
"Èl es tan sereno y suave, especialmente frente a las damas o barack obama, es tan suave y refinado ahora, recuerda cuando estÈs en una fiesta la prÛxima vez y veas a esta persona que lo es.",Spanish
"educado, culto y sofisticado.",Spanish

"ahora usamos a menudo la palabra impresionante aqu‡≠ ' s otra palabra que puedes usar en lugar de asombroso estupendo, por ejemplo, hoy obtuve una puntuaciÛn estupenda en mi examen, lo que significa que obtuve una puntuaciÛn muy alta o. Obtuve una puntuaciÛn casi perfecta.",Spanish
La palabra estupendo tiene ra‡≠ces latinas cl‡sicas de la palabra que significa.,Spanish
"Estar aturdido tan estupendo se usa para describir algo que es incre‡≠blemente bueno, por ejemplo, se ve estupenda con ese vestido o quÈ vista tan estupenda desde este balcÛn o estoy leyendo este libro estupendo que no puedo dejar de escribir quÈ tal si vas y contar.",Spanish

"Nature Ë una delle pi˘ antiche ed importanti riviste scientifiche esistenti, forse in assoluto quella considerata di maggior prestigio nell'ambito della comunit‡† scientifica internazionale (insieme a Science).",Italian
[1] Viene pubblicata fin dal 4 novembre 1869.,Italian
"[2] Nonostante la maggior parte delle riviste del campo siano oggi altamente specializzate, Nature Ë uno dei pochi giornali, insieme ad altri mensili quali Science e Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, che pubblica ancora articoli originali su svariati campi scientifici.",Italian
"Molti sono gli avanzamenti e le scoperte, provenienti da molti campi della ricerca scientifica, che sono stati pubblicati su Nature, come articoli o lettere: ad esempio, la scoperta dei raggi X, la natura ondulatoria delle particelle, la scoperta dei neutroni, le scoperte sulla fissione nucleare, la struttura a doppia elica del DNA, la prima struttura molecolare di una proteina (la mioglobina), la tettonica a zolle, il buco dell'ozono, la prima clonazione di un mammifero (la pecora Dolly), il sequenziamento del genoma umano.",Italian
"Il fattore di impatto (impact factor) di questa rivista supera nel 2014 l'enorme valore di 42,352.",Italian
"[3] Oltre a Nature stesso, ci sono tre famiglie di riviste scientifiche legate a Nature, edite dal Nature Publishing Group: In un'intervista pubblicata nel 2013 su The Guardian, Randy Schekman rilascia delle dichiarazioni riguardanti le grandi riviste scientifiche (facendo il nome di Nature, Science o Cell), additandole come colpevoli di danneggiare l'attivit‡† di ricerca scientifica.",Italian
"Secondo Randy Schekman l'incentivo pi˘ forte nella ricerca scientifica Ë quello di vedere pubblicate le proprie ricerche nelle prestigiose riviste scientifiche, poichÈ a questo viene fatto coincidere il pi˘ alto riconoscimento del proprio lavoro; tale ragionamento Ë razionale, ma non porta sempre a servire gli interessi della propria professione, nÈ quelli dell'umanit‡† o della societ‡†.",Italian
"Questo perchÈ le grandi riviste scientifiche tendono a ´curare in modo aggressivo i loro brand mettendo al primo posto la vendita di abbonamenti, pi˘ che la pubblicazione di tutte le ricerche pi˘ significative [...] mentre pubblicano molte ricerche rilevanti, tendono tuttavia a non pubblicare tutte le ricerche rilevanti, nÈ sono gli unici a pubblicarleª.",Italian
"Nell'articolo Randy Schekman critica sia la selezione assai restrittiva delle ricerche pubblicate da parte delle riviste scientifiche famose, sia l'impact factor, considerandolo come un trucco di marketing dietro il quale le grandi riviste acquistano notoriet‡†; infatti l'impact factor misura solamente il numero delle volte che una determinata rivista scientifica risulta citata nelle ricerche scientifiche successive, senza considerare la qualit‡† o l'importanza della ricerca stessa ´una rivista scientifica puÚ venire citata perchÈ pubblica ricerche significative, o anche perchÈ pubblica qualcosa di accattivante, provocativo o addirittura sbagliatoª.",Italian
"Questo influenza l'attivit‡† di ricerca, in quanto la indirizza in quella direzione dove Ë possibile tirare fuori le conclusioni che vogliono queste riviste, scoraggiando invece una direzione che potrebbe essere pi˘ importante, ma magari meno accattivante ai lettori.",Italian
"[4] Altri progetti Wikipedia (pronuncia: vedi sotto) Ë un'enciclopedia online a contenuto libero, collaborativa, multilingue e gratuita, nata nel 2001, sostenuta e ospitata dalla Wikimedia Foundation, un'organizzazione non a scopo di lucro statunitense.",Italian
"Lanciata da Jimmy Wales e Larry Sanger il 15 gennaio 2001, inizialmente nell'edizione in lingua inglese, nei mesi successivi ha aggiunto edizioni in numerose altre lingue.",Italian
"Sanger ne suggerÏ il nome,[1] una parola macedonia nata dall'unione della radice wiki al suffisso pedia (da enciclopedia).",Italian
"Etimologicamente, Wikipedia significa ""cultura veloce"", dal termine hawaiano wiki (veloce), con l'aggiunta del suffisso -pedia (dal greco antico œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ±, paideia, formazione).",Italian
"Con pi˘ di 55 milioni di voci in oltre 300 lingue,[2] Ë l'enciclopedia pi˘ grande mai scritta,[3][4] Ë tra i dieci siti web pi˘ visitati al mondo[5] e costituisce la maggiore e pi˘ consultata opera di riferimento generalista su Internet.",Italian
"[6][7][8] Wikipedia prese il via come progetto complementare di Nupedia, un progetto per la creazione di un'enciclopedia libera online le cui voci erano scritte da esperti volontari attraverso un processo formale di revisione.",Italian
"Nupedia venne fondata il 9 marzo 2000 dalla societ‡† Bomis, proprietaria dell'omonimo portale di ricerca.",Italian
"Le figure principali erano Jimmy Wales, allora CEO della Bomis, e Larry Sanger, redattore capo di Nupedia e successivamente di Wikipedia.",Italian
"[9] Per il concetto di wiki, Wales e Sanger dichiararono di essersi ispirati ai siti WikiWikiWeb o Portland Pattern Repository di Ward Cunningham.",Italian
"Wikipedia, che esisteva gi‡† come servizio di Nupedia.com dal 10 gennaio 2001, fu formalmente lanciata il 15 gennaio successivo sul sito Wikipedia.com, in lingua inglese.",Italian
"Verso maggio giunsero i primi utenti registrati e, nel corso dell'anno, si svilupparono le edizioni in francese, tedesco, inglese, catalano, spagnolo, svedese, portoghese e, a fine anno, italiano.",Italian
"Alla fine del suo primo anno di esistenza, l'enciclopedia arrivÚ a contare quasi 20†000 voci, su 18 edizioni in lingue differenti.",Italian
"Raggiunse 26 edizioni in lingua alla fine del 2002, 46 alla fine del 2003 e 161 alla fine del 2004.",Italian
"Nupedia e Wikipedia coesistettero finchÈ i server della prima furono chiusi definitivamente nel 2003 e i suoi testi incorporati in Wikipedia (Nupedia aveva sofferto un tasso di crescita estremamente lento, a causa dei complicati processi di revisione, riuscendo a pubblicare solo 24 voci); Sanger uscÏ di scena e un gruppo di utenti attuÚ una biforcazione della Wikipedia in spagnolo per costituire l'Enciclopedia Libre.",Italian
"Da Wikipedia e Nupedia, nacque nel 2003 la Wikimedia Foundation, l'organizzazione non profit che sostiene Wikipedia e i progetti fratelli (il primo dei quali fu In Memoriam: September 11 Wiki) che nel tempo si sono aggiunti, ognuno dei quali Ë specializzato in un determinato ambito del sapere.",Italian
"La Wikimedia Foundation ha infatti successivamente dato vita a progetti complementari tra i quali: Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikisource, Wikispecies, Wikiquote, Wikinotizie, Wikiversit‡† e Wikivoyage.",Italian
"Wales cedette tutti i diritti alla fondazione da lui promossa, che tuttora gestisce i marchi e l'infrastruttura informatica, garantendo che la gestione dei contenuti rimanesse affidata alla comunit‡† degli utenti.",Italian
"Se nei primi due anni cresceva alla velocit‡† di poche centinaia o meno di nuove voci al giorno, l'edizione in inglese di Wikipedia raggiunse il traguardo delle 100†000 voci nel gennaio 2003, mentre nel 2004 subÏ un'esplosione, raddoppiando le dimensioni in un anno (con un aumento da 1†000 a 3†000 voci al giorno).",Italian
"Wikipedia ha raggiunto la sua milionesima voce, tra le 105 edizioni in lingua all'epoca presenti, il 20 settembre 2004.",Italian
"A partire dal 2004 Ë iniziata a costituirsi una rete di associazioni nazionali collegate alla Wikimedia Foundation (chiamati ""capitoli ufficiali""), tra le quali Wikimedia Italia, fondata nel 2005.",Italian
Nel settembre dello stesso anno l'edizione in italiano ha superato le 100†000 voci.,Italian
"Da quando Wikipedia ha raggiunto un considerevole numero di voci e di utilizzatori, Ë diventata un tipico fenomeno del Web 2.0, grazie anche alla sua particolarit‡† di essere rapidamente modificabile e aggiornabile da chiunque.",Italian
"Nel settembre 2007, l'edizione in inglese ha tagliato lo storico traguardo di 2 milioni di voci, divenendo la pi˘ vasta enciclopedia mai scritta, superando l'enciclopedia Yongle (1407), che ha detenuto tale primato per 600 anni esatti;[3] nel Guinness dei primati del 2008 Wikipedia Ë riportata come la pi˘ grande enciclopedia al mondo.",Italian
"[4] Il 27 marzo 2008, con oltre 250 edizioni locali, ha raggiunto i 10 milioni di voci,[10] che erano raddoppiate il 18 novembre 2011[11] e triplicate nel giro dei tre anni successivi, superando nel 2015 i 35 milioni di voci.",Italian
"A settembre 2015 le edizioni di Wikipedia con pi˘ di 100†000 voci erano divenute 53, scritte in altrettante lingue, di cui 12 superavano il milione.",Italian
"[2] L'obiettivo di Wikipedia Ë creare un'enciclopedia libera, ovvero liberamente accessibile, a contenuto libero, aperto, e ""universale"" in termini di ampiezza di argomenti trattati.",Italian
"Wikipedia Ë stata descritta da Jimmy Wales, uno dei suoi fondatori, come ´uno sforzo per creare e distribuire un'enciclopedia libera della pi˘ alta qualit‡† possibile a ogni singola persona sul pianeta nella sua propria lingua.ª Wikipedia, nelle intenzioni di Wales, doveva raggiungere nel lungo termine una qualit‡† pari o migliore dell'Enciclopedia Britannica ed essere pubblicata anche su carta.",Italian
"Il progetto, ambizioso, ma realistico, si colloca dunque nell'ambito della condivisione della conoscenza e della cultura partecipativa sfruttando la cosiddetta intelligenza collettiva sulla base delle regole d'uso e di contribuzione espresse dall'enciclopedia stessa.",Italian
"In quanto enciclopedia a carattere universale (o ""generalista""), Wikipedia tratta voci di molti argomenti diversi.",Italian
Le voci sono organizzate in categorie tematiche; i temi generali sono generalmente illustrati da portali e coordinati tramite progetti.,Italian
"L'enciclopedia Ë completamente gratuita e priva di pubblicit‡†, in linea con i suoi principi base: il suo sostentamento Ë dovuto unicamente alle libere donazioni degli utenti, grazie a una raccolta fondi[12] avviata ogni anno dalla Wikimedia Foundation.",Italian
"Il logo ufficiale di Wikipedia Ë una sfera quasi completa costruita con pezzi di puzzle che riportano caratteri di vari alfabeti, a simboleggiare il mondo e una conoscenza globale in costruzione, a disposizione di tutti.",Italian
Su Internet esistono o sono esistiti molti altri progetti enciclopedici.,Italian
"In generale dispongono di una linea editoriale stabilita e fanno uso delle tradizionali politiche sulla propriet‡† intellettuale dei contenuti, come per esempio l'Enciclopedia Stanford di Filosofia, compilata da esperti.",Italian
"Siti web pi˘ informali, come H2g2 o Everything2, servono come guide generali le cui voci sono scritte e controllate da persone comuni.",Italian
"Progetti come Wikipedia, Susning.nu e la Enciclopedia Libre sono invece wiki le cui voci sono sviluppate da numerosi autori e in cui non esiste alcun processo formale di revisione.",Italian
Wikipedia Ë il primo e pi˘ grande di questi wiki enciclopedici per numero di voci.,Italian
"A differenza delle enciclopedie che l'hanno preceduta, il contenuto di Wikipedia Ë distribuito con una licenza libera.",Italian
"Wikipedia Ë pubblicata in 309 lingue differenti (di cui circa 299 attive[2]) e contiene voci sia sugli argomenti propri di una tradizionale enciclopedia sia su quelli di almanacchi, dizionari geografici e specialistici.",Italian
"Il suo scopo Ë quello di raccogliere dati, informazioni e descrizioni, creando e distribuendo al pubblico un'enciclopedia libera, gratuita e sempre pi˘ ricca di contenuti.",Italian
"Le varie edizioni in lingua sono sviluppate indipendentemente l'una dall'altra, ovvero non sono vincolate ai contenuti presenti nelle altre, ma sono tenute unicamente al rispetto delle linee guida generali del progetto come il punto di vista neutrale.",Italian
"I testi delle voci e i contenuti multimediali tuttavia sono spesso condivisi tra le varie edizioni: i primi grazie alle traduzioni, i secondi attraverso il progetto condiviso chiamato Wikimedia Commons.",Italian
Le voci tradotte rappresentano una percentuale relativamente piccola di quelle presenti in ciascuna edizione.,Italian
"Le edizioni in lingua tedesca, quella in lingua italiana e una selezione di voci tratte dalla versione in lingua inglese sono state distribuite anche su compact disc e DVD, mentre di molte edizioni sono stati creati dei mirror online o dei progetti derivati.",Italian
"Ad agosto 2015 Wikipedia conteneva in totale pi˘ di 35 milioni di voci - in totale oltre 135 milioni di pagine, modificate oltre 2 miliardi di volte - e contava oltre 55 milioni di utenti registrati.",Italian
"[2] Wikipedia Ë uno dei dieci siti pi˘ visitati al mondo, oscillando nel 2015 tra il sesto e il settimo posto nella classifica mondiale:[13] riceve infatti oltre 374 milioni di visitatori unici al mese (a settembre 2015).",Italian
[che sito si intende?,Italian
"wikipedia.org, en.wikipedia.org o tutte le edizioni linguistiche assieme?",Italian
][14] Le voci di Wikipedia sono spesso citate dai mass media tradizionali e da istituti accademici.,Italian
"´""L'enciclopedia partecipata"" mi preoccupa meno: la uso regolarmente, e trovo che la qualit‡† e l'affidabilit‡† delle informazioni sia notevole.",Italian
Qualche problema c'Ë solo quando il soggetto Ë estremamente controverso.,Italian
"In questo caso la neutralit‡† e le reciproche obiezioni spingono verso il minimo comun denominatore, e bisogna accontentarsi.",Italian
"Ma questo Ë inevitabile, e in fondo accadeva gi‡† con le enciclopedie tradizionali.ª La caratteristica primaria di Wikipedia Ë il fatto che d‡† la possibilit‡† a chiunque di collaborare, utilizzando un sistema di modifica e pubblicazione aperto che si appoggia su una piattaforma Wiki (MediaWiki).",Italian
In altri termini essa Ë curata da volontari ovvero le pagine possono essere modificate da chiunque e non c'Ë un comitato di redazione nÈ alcun controllo preventivo sul contenuto inviato.,Italian
"In particolare essa si basa sul diritto di citazione come testimonianza di attendibilit‡† dei contenuti presenti che citino dunque la fonte di origine, classificandosi dunque come fonte terziaria.",Italian
"La registrazione non Ë obbligatoria, ma consigliata.",Italian
"A causa della sua natura aperta, vandalismi e imprecisioni sono problemi riscontrabili in Wikipedia.",Italian
"Il miglioramento dell'enciclopedia Ë dovuto unicamente al continuo apporto di contributi sia in termini di nuovi contenuti che di revisioni degli stessi, della forma e della formattazione secondo le linee guida da parte di tutti gli utenti volontari[16].",Italian
Caratteristica delle voci di Wikipedia Ë inoltre l'avere frequenti collegamenti ipertestuali ad altre voci dell'enciclopedia che permettono una facile navigazione nel Portale e un pi˘ facile approfondimento di altre voci con uno stile dunque che ricorda il Web 1.0 o Web statico mentre di fatto la piattaforma Mediawiki appartiene al Web 2.0 o Web dinamico.,Italian
"Tutte le voci sono comunemente rintracciabili tramite ricerca web con Google, che solitamente indicizza tra le prime posizioni, ma l'enciclopedia puÚ essere vista come un vero e proprio portale web il cui accesso Ë dalla Pagina Principale che fornisce in primo piano una voce del giorno, una voce di qualit‡†, ricorrenze del giorno, un motore di ricerca interno ecc.",Italian
Le foto delle varie voci provengono dal progetto Wikimedia Commons sui cui vengono caricate e poi richiamate nelle voci di Wikipedia.,Italian
"Per garantire tale progresso, Wikipedia si fonda su cinque pilastri, sulle seguenti linee guida, volte ad identificare quali tipi di informazioni siano adatte a esservi inserite e su un codice di comportamento detto Wikiquette.",Italian
"Ad esse si fa spesso riferimento nelle dispute per decidere se un particolare contenuto debba essere aggiunto, rivisto, trasferito ad un progetto affine oppure rimosso.",Italian
"Uno dei principi alla base di Wikipedia Ë il ""punto di vista neutrale"",[17] secondo il quale ad esempio le opinioni presentate da personaggi importanti o da opere letterarie vengono riassunte senza tentare di determinarne una verit‡† oggettiva.",Italian
Le edizioni di Wikipedia contengono spesso anche uno ''sportello informazioni'' in cui la comunit‡† risponde alle domande tecniche degli utenti.,Italian
"Originariamente pubblicata sotto la licenza libera GFDL, dal 15 giugno 2009 Ë migrata alla licenza Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0, pi˘ compatibile con gli scopi e gli usi di Wikipedia e in generale dei progetti Wikimedia (le licenze Creative Commons non esistevano nel 2001 alla nascita del progetto).",Italian
Il cambiamento di licenza Ë stato sottoposto a votazione della comunit‡†.,Italian
"[18][19] La licenza sotto la quale le voci di Wikipedia sono rese disponibili Ë una delle molte licenze di copyright di tipo permissivo (ma dal copyleft di tipo ""forte""), in quanto permette la redistribuzione, la creazione di opere derivate e l'uso commerciale del contenuto a condizione che si mantenga l'attribuzione agli autori e che il contenuto rimanga disponibile sotto la stessa licenza.",Italian
"Quando un utente contribuisce al progetto con materiale originale, i diritti d'autore rimangono in suo possesso ma egli acconsente a concedere la propria opera sotto la licenza libera.",Italian
"Il materiale di Wikipedia puÚ quindi essere distribuito a, o incorporato da, fonti che a loro volta usino questa licenza.",Italian
Del contenuto di Wikipedia sono stati creati numerosi mirror o progetti derivati a partire da copie dei database.,Italian
"Sebbene tutti i testi siano disponibili sotto la stessa licenza, una percentuale significativa di immagini e suoni in Wikipedia non sono liberi: elementi come loghi aziendali, saggi, testi di canzoni o foto giornalistiche protette da copyright sono usate con una rivendicazione di fair use (tuttavia, in alcuni Paesi il concetto di fair use non Ë presente nel corpo legislativo, e quindi opere che contenessero questi elementi potrebbero essere inammissibili).",Italian
Wikipedia ha ricevuto anche del materiale a condizione che non si possano produrre lavori derivati o che possa essere usato solo all'interno di Wikipedia.,Italian
Alcune edizioni comunque accettano solo contenuti multimediali liberi da copyright.,Italian
"Wikipedia condivide le risorse software e hardware con gli altri progetti della Wikimedia Foundation, in particolare il motore che interpreta il markup delle pagine (MediaWiki) e i server su cui sono salvati i database che contengono le pagine dell'enciclopedia.",Italian
A maggio 2017 sono presenti 296 diverse edizioni linguistiche di Wikipedia (di cui 285 attive).,Italian
"La versione in lingua italiana di Wikipedia Ë soprannominata it.wiki ed Ë nata a maggio del 2001, sotto il nome a dominio di terzo livello it.wikipedia.org.",Italian
Nel 2003 nascono le Wikipedia in latino e in occitano.,Italian
"Ad aprile 2004 nasce la Wikipedia in sardo, poi a ottobre la Wikipedia in siciliano, a gennaio 2005 la Wikipedia in friulano e a seguire, nel corso del 2005, le versioni linguistiche in corso, napoletano, romancio, veneto e lombardo.",Italian
"Nel 2006 sono nate poi le edizioni in ligure, piemontese, francoprovenzale e tarantino.",Italian
Nel 2007 Ë nata quella in emiliano e romagnolo.,Italian
"La creazione della Wikipedia in lingua ladina Ë stata in fase di test fino al 2020, quando Ë stata resa operativa.",Italian
"[20] Il nome Wikipedia Ë composto dal prefisso wiki- (dall'hawaiano wiki, veloce), e dal suffisso -pedia (dal greco antico paideia, formazione).",Italian
"Il progetto non prevede una pronuncia ufficiale del suo nome proprio, ma lascia libert‡† di pronunciarlo secondo le proprie preferenze.",Italian
"La pronuncia vichipedÏa sarebbe preferibile in quanto linguisticamente pi˘ integrata, considerando la pronuncia consolidata in lingua italiana del suffisso -pedÏa (-pedÏa /peÀàdia/, come in enciclopedia)[21] e la pronuncia consolidata della lettera w di wiki (vÏchi /Ààviki/, come in wafer o wc).",Italian
[21][22] Anche l'Accademia della Crusca si Ë espressa analogamente in pi˘ occasioni.,Italian
"[23] Le pronunce anglicizzanti (o inglesi italianizzate), meno integrate nel sistema linguistico dell'italiano, sono tuttavia diffuse.",Italian
"Il Dizionario di pronuncia italiana di Luciano Canepari, uniformandosi alla pronuncia inglese, riporta /wikiÀàp…õdja/ (uichipËdia) come forma primaria, /wikiÀàpidja/ (uichipÏdia) come accettabile e /wikipeÀàdia/ (uichipedÏa) come pronuncia intenzionale ´per fare sfoggioª.",Italian
"[24] In inglese si dice comunemente [Àåw…™kiÀàpiÀêdi…ô] o [ÀåwiÀêkiÀàpiÀêdi…ô], ma non esiste una pronuncia ufficiale.",Italian
"Wikipedia non Ë regolata da alcun comitato di redazione centrale: le sue voci sono scritte spontaneamente da centinaia di migliaia di volontari non remunerati nÈ iscritti ad associazioni, che si organizzano autonomamente stabilendo da soli le regole interne e lo svolgimento degli argomenti nelle voci.",Italian
"Wikipedia, infatti, Ë costruita sulla convinzione che la collaborazione tra gli utenti possa nel tempo migliorare le voci, pi˘ o meno nello stesso spirito con cui viene sviluppato il software libero.",Italian
"Nel caso del software, se Ë libero, chiunque puÚ prelevarne i sorgenti, modificarli e ridistribuirli, eppure solitamente i programmatori si limitano a proporre alcune modifiche agli autori, i quali le adottano oppure no a loro insindacabile giudizio.",Italian
Le voci sono sempre aperte alle modifiche (tranne quando vengono protette a tempo determinato a causa di vandalismi o edit war) e non si dichiara mai conclusa la stesura di una voce.,Italian
"Accade che alcuni utenti provino a inserire informazioni malevole o goliardiche, ma enciclopedicamente irrilevanti, che vengono generalmente rimosse prontamente da altri utenti.",Italian
Questo tipo di modifiche Ë in gergo chiamato vandalismo.,Italian
Wikipedia mantiene un approccio ottimistico sulla bont‡† delle modifiche proposte: tutti coloro che visitano il sito di Wikipedia hanno la possibilit‡† di creare o modificare una voce e vedere pubblicate all'istante le loro modifiche.,Italian
"Gli autori delle voci, che non devono avere necessariamente alcuna competenza o qualifica formale sugli argomenti trattati ma devono basare le proprie pubblicazioni su fonti autorevoli, sono perÚ avvertiti che i loro contributi possono essere cancellati, o a loro volta modificati e redistribuiti da chiunque, nei termini della licenza e delle linee guida interne a Wikipedia.",Italian
"Le voci sono controllate dalla comunit‡†, con il supporto di un gruppo di amministratori che svolgono alcune azioni tecniche.",Italian
"Le decisioni da prendere sul contenuto e sulle politiche editoriali di Wikipedia sono ottenute di norma per consenso[25] e in alcuni casi per votazione, sebbene per alcuni anni Jimmy Wales si fosse riservato decisioni in alcuni casi nell'edizione in inglese.",Italian
"Grazie al software wiki, tutte le modifiche alle voci di Wikipedia sono archiviate in una cronologia delle versioni accessibile a chiunque.",Italian
"Wikipedia perciÚ Ë anche la prima tra le grandi enciclopedie che permette a tutti di osservare il processo di sviluppo nel tempo di una voce e di verificare se, come e dove il contenuto Ë stato oggetto di controversie.",Italian
Persino le cancellazioni e gli altri vandalismi che una pagina subisce sono di norma visibili a tutti.,Italian
"Tutti i punti di vista contestati, espressi in un dato momento e successivamente cancellati, rimangono consultabili e forniscono informazioni complementari sull'argomento di cui Ë oggetto la voce e sul suo grado di controversia, aggiungendovi inoltre la dimensione temporale.",Italian
Oltre all'editor classico che utilizza un linguaggio di markup estremamente semplificato (ad es.,Italian
"molto pi˘ semplice dell'HTML) il software MediaWiki mette a disposizione anche un editor visuale, chiamato VisualEditor.",Italian
"Nel gergo di Wikipedia gli autori - cioË quegli utenti che collaborano attivamente all'inserimento dei contenuti - sono chiamati ""wikipediani"" e formano un'ampia e variegata comunit‡† di pratica.",Italian
"L'attivit‡† di wikipediano Ë riconosciuta come ""profilo professionale"" dall'IWA (International Webmasters Association).",Italian
[26] Su Wikipedia non vi sono distinzioni formali tra chi collabora al progetto: le decisioni sono idealmente prese raggiungendo il consenso tra coloro che sono coinvolti.,Italian
"Nel mese di giugno 2015, gli utenti attivi (cioË quelli che avevano contribuito a Wikipedia con almeno cinque interventi ciascuno) erano 71†000[27] (oltre 40†000 nell'ambito delle tre edizioni maggiori, ovvero quelle in lingua inglese, tedesca e giapponese).",Italian
"Il gruppo pi˘ attivo, composto da quasi 10†000 utenti (di cui circa il 50% lavorava nelle tre edizioni maggiori), ha fornito 100 contributi o pi˘ a testa nel corso del mese.",Italian
"[28] Secondo Wikimedia un quarto del traffico di Wikipedia proviene da utenti non registrati, che difficilmente diventeranno collaboratori stabili.",Italian
"I lavori di manutenzione sono svolti da un gruppo di volontari che sono chiamati, a seconda del ruolo, sviluppatori,[29] steward,[30] check user,[31] oversight,[32] burocrati[33] e amministratori;[34] nel complesso alcune migliaia di persone.",Italian
"Gli amministratori (sysop) sono i pi˘ numerosi (oltre quattromila al 2015) e sono loro attribuite alcune funzioni tecniche aggiuntive che servono ad impedire, in caso di necessit‡†, la modifica di singole voci, di cancellare e ripristinare le voci o di togliere (in modo temporaneo o permanente) ad alcuni utenti la facolt‡† di modificare Wikipedia, seguendo quanto stabilito dalle linee guida della comunit‡†.",Italian
"Non essendo gli amministratori dei moderatori, il controllo e l'eliminazione dei vandalismi sono a carico di tutta la comunit‡† degli utenti.",Italian
"Gli atti di vandalismo o le infrazioni pi˘ lievi alle linee guida possono comportare un avvertimento o un blocco temporaneo, mentre i blocchi a lungo termine o permanenti in conseguenza di infrazioni prolungate e gravi sono in genere decisi dalla comunit‡† o, in alcune edizioni, da un comitato arbitrale.",Italian
"[35] L'ex redattore capo di Wikipedia Larry Sanger ha affermato che avere la licenza libera GFDL come ""garanzia di libert‡†, Ë una forte motivazione a lavorare in un'enciclopedia libera"".",Italian
"In uno studio su Wikipedia come comunit‡†, il docente di economia Andrea Ciffolilli[36] sostenne che il basso costo di transazione nella partecipazione ad un software wiki crea un catalizzatore per lo sviluppo collaborativo e che un approccio alla ""costruzione creativa"" incoraggia la partecipazione.",Italian
Wikipedia Ë stata vista come un esperimento sociale di democrazia.,Italian
"Il suo fondatore ha replicato che non Ë stata pensata come tale, ma piuttosto ne Ë una conseguenza.",Italian
"[37] In una pagina a proposito del fare ricerche con Wikipedia, i suoi autori spiegano che Wikipedia Ë importante come comunit‡† sociale: agli autori di voci puÚ venir chiesto di difendere o spiegare il loro operato e le discussioni sono immediatamente visibili.",Italian
"Wikipedia possiede una comunit‡† di utenti che sono in proporzione pochi, ma molto attivi.",Italian
"William G. Emigh e Susan C. Herring (2005) affermano che ´pochi utenti attivi, quando agiscono in concerto con norme stabilite all'interno di un sistema redazionale aperto, possono raggiungere il controllo totale sul contenuto prodotto nel sistema, cancellando letteralmente diversit‡†, controversie e inconsistenze, e omogeneizzando le voci dei collaboratori.ª[38] I redattori di Wikinfo, un progetto derivato da Wikipedia, sostengono analogamente che i contributori nuovi o controversi di Wikipedia sono spesso ingiustamente etichettati troll o utenti problematici e viene loro impedito di apportare modifiche.",Italian
La comunit‡† di Wikipedia Ë stata anche criticata per il fatto di rispondere alle lamentele riguardo alla qualit‡† di una voce consigliando a chi si lamenta di correggere la voce.,Italian
"Wikipedia richiede ai propri collaboratori di osservare un punto di vista neutrale[17] quando scrivono e di non inserire alcuna ricerca originale, dal momento che un'enciclopedia Ë una fonte terziaria.",Italian
"Questa condotta, se rigorosamente applicata, mette al sicuro l'enciclopedia da eventuali minacce legali per reati di diffamazione e al contempo le conferisce obiettivit‡† e affidabilit‡†.",Italian
"Il punto di vista neutrale, di per sÈ una linea di condotta non negoziabile, rende chiaro che l'obiettivo dell'enciclopedia Ë quello di presentare le dispute e descriverle piuttosto che impegnarsi per esse.",Italian
"Qualora fosse completamente raggiunto, Wikipedia non si troverebbe ad essere scritta sulla base di un singolo punto di vista ""oggettivo"", ma a presentare in modo imparziale tutti gli aspetti di una questione, attribuendoli in modo neutrale ai propri sostenitori.",Italian
Questa politica impone che ciascun punto di vista debba ricevere una trattazione adeguata al suo seguito.,Italian
"Le opinioni e teorie inedite sono considerate ""ricerche originali"" e non sono pubblicabili in Wikipedia, dato che sono incompatibili con il concetto di enciclopedia (che Ë un'opera compilativa) e non possono essere presentate secondo un punto di vista neutrale e con fonti indipendenti.",Italian
I collaboratori di Wikipedia mantengono in pi˘ una variet‡† di politiche e linee guida minori.,Italian
"Al contrario di altri progetti basati su wiki, come il Portland Pattern Repository di Ward Cunningham (considerato l'inventore del wiki), i wikipediani usano le cosiddette pagine di discussione[39] per discutere le modifiche alle voci, piuttosto che farlo all'interno delle voci stesse.",Italian
"I collaboratori di Wikipedia spesso modificano, spostano e cancellano le voci che sono considerate inadatte a un'enciclopedia, come le definizioni da dizionario (per cui esistono progetti appositi come il Wikizionario) o testi da fonti originali.",Italian
"Le varie edizioni di Wikipedia, facenti capo a comunit‡† distinte su base linguistica, stabiliscono autonomamente le proprie convenzioni stilistiche.",Italian
Il contenuto di Wikipedia viene distribuito in diverse modalit‡†.,Italian
"A parte la distribuzione nella sua forma originale online, attraverso i siti ufficiali o i molti mirror creati su altri server web, anche le versioni stampate o pronte alla stampa di Wikipedia hanno ottenuto popolarit‡†.",Italian
I cosiddetti WikiReader (pubblicazioni su carta con selezioni di voci) sono stati lanciati dalla Wikipedia tedesca nel tardo febbraio 2004 con il primo WikiReader sulla Svezia di Thomas Karcher.,Italian
Hanno fatto seguito altri WikiReader preparati nel formato PDF o con le versioni stampate in preparazione per la vendita.,Italian
"L'esempio tedesco Ë stato ripreso altrove per cui sono nati altri progetti WikiReader ad opera degli utenti cinesi, inglesi, francesi e polacchi.",Italian
Wikipress[40] ha messo in vendita un libro in brossura dell'edizione 2005-2006 comprensivo di un DVD.,Italian
"In seguito, nel 2009, Ë stata aggiunta a Wikipedia un'estensione con la quale ogni utente puÚ raccogliere pi˘ voci dell'enciclopedia in ""libri"" che possono essere consultati offline e distribuiti come e-book gratuiti o anche essere stampati in volume grazie ad un servizio online a pagamento.",Italian
Sono disponibili anche CD e DVD di Wikipedia.,Italian
Il progetto tedesco di Wikipedia Ë stato il primo a distribuire una versione su questi supporti nel 2004; attualmente Ë giunto alla seconda edizione.,Italian
"A partire dal settembre 2007 anche l'edizione in italiano di Wikipedia Ë stata pubblicata in una versione in DVD, diventando cosÏ la seconda ad essere distribuita su tale supporto.",Italian
"[41] I contenuti di Wikipedia sono consultabili anche tramite dispositivi mobili (cellulari, palmari, smartphone, ecc.).",Italian
"Esiste infatti una versione mobile del sito, che consente di accedere alle voci di Wikipedia presentandole in una veste grafica semplificata, adatta per questo tipo di dispositivi.",Italian
"Il servizio QRpedia consente di generare codici QR contenenti particolari link che permettono di accedere alla versione di Wikipedia mobile di una data voce, puntando automaticamente alla pagina nella stessa lingua del dispositivo in uso.",Italian
"Sono disponibili inoltre applicazioni dedicate per i vari dispositivi mobili, ad esempio Wikipedia Mobile per iPhone e Wikipedia Mobile per Android.",Italian
"´L'atteggiamento dell'accademico medio verso il principale strumento di consultazione della nostra epoca, e in particolare dei nostri studenti, conferma conclusioni cui eravamo gi‡† arrivati.",Italian
"Egli quasi sempre consulta Wikipedia (non per propria scelta, ma perchÈ i motori di ricerca lo dirigono automaticamente alle sue voci), ma non prende in considerazione la possibilit‡† di contribuirvi per tre motivi principali: perchÈ la ritiene di livello troppo basso nel proprio settore specialistico; perchÈ ritiene sÈ stesso troppo incompetente in qualsiasi altro settore e perchÈ non ha tempo da perdere in lavori che non assicurano nÈ compensi economici nÈ titoli utili alla carriera.ª La reputazione di Wikipedia quale mezzo di consultazione Ë soggetta a discussioni di opposti orientamenti: da una parte elogiata per la sua libera distribuzione, libera compilazione e ampia gamma di argomenti trattati, dall'altra criticata per presunti pregiudizi sistemici (secondo cui vengono privilegiate le voci di interesse dei singoli contributori indipendentemente dalla loro oggettiva importanza), lacune su alcuni argomenti e mancanza di responsabilit‡† e autorit‡† in rapporto alle enciclopedie tradizionali.",Italian
"Anche il concetto di ""enciclopedia"" di Wikipedia Ë oggetto di dibattito, a maggior ragione da quando essa ha incrementato la sua importanza.",Italian
"Le critiche pi˘ frequenti riguardano una mancanza di affidabilit‡†, conoscenza e autorevolezza.",Italian
"La critica pi˘ forte riguarda l'affidabilit‡† in termini di contenuti; fermo restando la natura work in progress dell'opera ovvero la continua tendenza al miglioramento nel tempo in termini di completezza e affidabilit‡† dei contenuti, al riguardo uno studio della rivista Nature del 2008, che ha messo a confronto la versione inglese di Wikipedia con la famosa enciclopedia Britannica, ha evidenziato una differenza minima in termini di errori tra le due (4 errori in media per ciascuna voce di Wikipedia e 3 per la Britannica).",Italian
"[42] Addetti ai lavori del mondo cartaceo (bibliotecari, accademici, redattori ed editori di enciclopedie classiche) considerano invece Wikipedia di scarsa o nulla utilit‡† quale mezzo di consultazione.",Italian
"Per contro altri ritengono Wikipedia di qualit‡† sufficiente in almeno alcune aree, in questo sostenuti dal fatto che essa ha vinto un test comparativo proposto da c't, rivista tedesca di informatica.",Italian
Molti degli elogi le sono attribuiti per il fatto di essere sia a contenuto libero sia aperta alle modifiche di chiunque.,Italian
"I redattori stessi di Wikipedia sono stati piuttosto attivi nel valutare, sia positivamente sia negativamente, l'enciclopedia.",Italian
"Una forte critica, nel 2007 viene da Robert Cailliau Äî uno degli ideatori del web[43] Äî che ha affermato che Wikipedia ´Ä¶rappresenta proprio ciÚ che non volevamo che diventasse il webª; questo perchÈ Wikipedia concentra in un solo ""luogo"" un gran numero di informazioni, invece nelle menti degli ideatori vi era una struttura a rete, in cui la parte tecnica, ma anche le informazioni fossero distribuite equamente sui suoi nodi, in modo che se venisse a mancare uno di questi nodi non si formasse una voragine d'informazione.",Italian
"[44] Di fatto Wikipedia funziona molto efficacemente come un aggregatore di informazioni e notizie provenienti da numerose fonti primarie (cartacee e web) di fronte all'enorme numero di informazioni disperse nel web, cresciute con il web stesso, stimolando allo stesso tempo la condivisione del sapere in rete e il senso di responsabilit‡†.",Italian
"Allo stesso tempo i difensori e fruitori ne esaltano la ""portabilit‡†"" rispetto alle enciclopedie cartacee ovvero la disponibilit‡† a portata di un ""click"".",Italian
"Per questo Wikipedia Ë stata usata dai media, da membri della comunit‡† accademica e da altri come fonte informativa principale o secondaria.",Italian
"Alcuni organi d'informazione hanno citato le voci di Wikipedia come fonte o le hanno segnalate tra le informazioni aggiuntive disponibili sul Web, in alcuni casi in modo reiterato.",Italian
"Secondo gli elenchi tenuti dai contributori di Wikipedia, le sue voci sono state citate con maggiore frequenza nei media di contenuto informativo, e pi˘ raramente anche in studi accademici, libri, conferenze e aule giudiziarie.",Italian
"Ad esempio, il sito del Parlamento del Canada cita la voce inglese di Wikipedia sui matrimoni gay tra le letture consigliate riguardo al proprio progetto di legge C-38.",Italian
Alcuni utenti mantengono liste (incomplete) dei casi in cui Wikipedia Ë stata citata come fonte.,Italian
I critici sostengono che l'accesso in scrittura a chiunque renda Wikipedia un prodotto inaffidabile.,Italian
"Wikipedia non contiene alcun processo formale e sistematico di revisione e, dunque, di controllo dei fatti: gli stessi contributori potrebbero non essere esperti negli argomenti di cui scrivono.",Italian
Il bibliotecario e consulente per Internet Philip Bradley dichiarÚ nel 2004 al britannico Guardian di non avere intenzione di utilizzare Wikipedia e di non essere ´a conoscenza di un solo bibliotecario che lo farebbe.,Italian
Il problema principale Ë la mancanza di autorevolezza.,Italian
"Per le pubblicazioni stampate, gli editori devono garantire che i loro dati siano attendibili in quanto il loro sostentamento dipende da ciÚ.",Italian
"Ma con qualcosa come questo, tutto ciÚ perde di significatoª.",Italian
[45] Analogamente il direttore responsabile dell'Encyclop‡¶dia Britannica Ted Pappas disse al Guardian: ´Il presupposto di Wikipedia Ë che il continuo miglioramento porter‡† alla perfezione.,Italian
Tale presupposto non Ë assolutamente dimostratoª.,Italian
"Nel discutere su Wikipedia come fonte accademica Danah Boyd, ricercatrice presso la School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS) dell'Universit‡† della California a Berkeley, scrisse nel 2005 che ´[Wikipedia] non sar‡† mai un'enciclopedia, ma conterr‡† una vasta conoscenza piuttosto valida per diversi scopiª.",Italian
"Alcuni articoli accademici sottoposti a revisione paritaria, come quelli pubblicati sulla rivista scientifica Science, hanno riportato dei riferimenti a voci di Wikipedia.",Italian
L'atteggiamento del mondo scientifico verso Wikimedia come strumento di consultazione non Ë stato solo negativo.,Italian
Le voci di Wikipedia sono state citate nelle enhanced perspectives (abstract delle pi˘ recenti ed entusiasmanti ricerche scientifiche) disponibili on line sul sito di Science.,Italian
"Il primo di tali abstract ad avere un link a Wikipedia fu A White Collar Protein Senses Blue Light (Linden, 2002), e da allora altre ne seguirono.",Italian
"Tali collegamenti, tuttavia, sono proposti al lettore solo come letture supplementari e non come fonti usate dall'autore dell'articolo, e le enhanced perspectives non sono pensate per servire, esse stesse, da materiale di riferimento.",Italian
"In un articolo del 2004, The Faith-Based Encyclopedia (L'enciclopedia basata sulla fiducia) l'ex direttore della Britannica Robert McHenry, criticÚ l'approccio wiki, sostenendo che ´Ä¶per quanto vicina Äî in qualche momento della sua vita Äî al raggiungimento della credibilit‡†, una voce di Wikipedia Ë sempre aperta a qualche ficcanaso poco informato o semi acculturatoÄ¶ L'utente che visita Wikipedia per apprendere qualche argomento, per confermare qualche dato di fatto, Ë piuttosto nella posizione dell'avventore di un bagno pubblico.",Italian
"Potrebbe essere palesemente sporco, cosÏ che egli sa di dover fare molta attenzione, o potrebbe sembrare discretamente pulito, cosÏ che egli potrebbe farsi cullare dal falso senso di sicurezza.",Italian
CiÚ che certamente non puÚ sapere Ë chi ha usato i servizi prima di luiª.,Italian
Per rispondere a tale critica sono stati proposti metodi per indicare l'origine del materiale nelle voci di Wikipedia.,Italian
"L'idea Ë di fornire una provenienza della fonte su ciascun intervallo del testo di una voce, e una provenienza temporale per indicarne l'annata.",Italian
"In questo modo il lettore puÚ conoscere ´chi ha usato i servizi prima di luiª e quanto tempo la comunit‡† ha impiegato per elaborare e giudicare le informazioni contenute in una voce allo scopo di fornire una calibratura sul ""senso di sicurezza"".",Italian
"Comunque, queste proposte riguardanti la provenienza sono abbastanza controverse.",Italian
"Uno degli ideatori del progetto, Larry Sanger, criticÚ Wikipedia nel 2004, per la sua supposta filosofia anti-elitaria di attivo disprezzo per la competenza.",Italian
"Il processo di redazione di Wikipedia presuppone che l'esposizione di una voce a molti utenti conduca, con il tempo di per sÈ, all'accuratezza.",Italian
"Facendo riferimento alla Legge di Linus sullo sviluppo open source, Sanger aveva in passato sostenuto che ´dati sufficienti occhi, tutti gli errori sono superficialiª.",Italian
"J≈çichi It≈ç, personaggio di spicco del mondo tecnologico, ha poi scritto, a proposito dell'autorit‡† in Wikipedia, che ´sebbene dipenda un po' dall'argomento, l'interrogativo Ë se qualcosa sia con tutta probabilit‡† vera quando provenga da una fonte il cui curriculum suoni autorevole oppure da una fonte che sia stata esaminata da centinaia di migliaia di persone (con la capacit‡† di commentare) e sia sopravvissutaª.",Italian
"Al contrario, in un test informale sulla capacit‡† di Wikipedia di individuare informazioni errate, l'autore sottolineÚ che il processo usato in Wikipedia ´non Ë realmente un meccanismo in grado di verificare i fatti tanto quanto lo sarebbe un meccanismo di votoª e che un materiale che non apparisse apertamente falso verrebbe accettato come vero.",Italian
Wikipedia Ë stata accusata di insufficienza nella conoscenza a causa della sua natura volontaria e di riflettere i pregiudizi sistemici dei suoi collaboratori.,Italian
"Il redattore capo della Britannica, Dale Hoiberg, ha commentato che ´le persone scrivono di cose alle quali sono interessate, perciÚ molti argomenti non vengono coperti e le notizie di attualit‡† sono trattate con molto dettaglio.",Italian
"Nell'edizione inglese di Wikipedia la voce sull'uragano Frances Ë lunga cinque volte quella sull'arte cinese, e la voce sulla soap opera Coronation Street Ë lunga il doppio di quella sul primo ministro inglese Tony Blair.ª L'ex redattore capo di Nupedia, Larry Sanger, affermÚ nel 2004 che ´quando si tratta di argomenti relativamente specializzati (al di fuori degli interessi di molti dei collaboratori), la credibilit‡† del progetto Ë molto irregolareª.",Italian
"Wikipedia Ë stata elogiata poichÈ, come wiki, permette alle voci di essere aggiornate o create in risposta ad avvenimenti di attualit‡†.",Italian
"Per esempio, la voce sul maremoto dell'Oceano Indiano nella sua edizione inglese venne citata spesso dalla stampa poco dopo l'episodio.",Italian
"I suoi redattori hanno anche affermato che Wikipedia, come sito web Ë capace di includere voci su un pi˘ ampio numero di argomenti di quanto potrebbe fare un'enciclopedia stampata.",Italian
"La rivista di informatica tedesca c't nell'ottobre 2004 ha fatto un confronto tra le enciclopedie Brockhaus Premium, Microsoft Encarta e Wikipedia.",Italian
Degli esperti hanno valutato 66 voci in varie discipline.,Italian
"Nel punteggio complessivo, Wikipedia ha ottenuto 3,6 punti su 5, la Brockhaus Premium 3,3 e Microsoft Encarta 3,1.",Italian
"In un'analisi sulle enciclopedie online, i professori della Indiana University Emigh e Herring, hanno poi sostenuto che ´Wikipedia apporta miglioramenti alle tradizionali fonti di informazione, specialmente per le aree in cui Ë forte, come tecnologia e avvenimenti d'attualit‡†ª.",Italian
Alla fine del 2005 Ë sorta una controversia dopo che il giornalista John Seigenthaler Sr. aveva notato come la sua biografia fosse stata vandalizzata inserendo informazioni false.,Italian
CiÚ ha portato alla decisione di restringere Äì nell'edizione di Wikipedia in inglese†Äì la possibilit‡† di creare nuove voci ai soli utenti registrati.,Italian
La rivista scientifica Nature nel 2005 riportava (anche in risposta al caso Seigenthaler) i risultati di uno studio comparato secondo cui le voci scientifiche in Wikipedia erano comparabili in accuratezza a quelle presenti nell'Enciclopedia Britannica (sull'edizione inglese di Wikipedia furono riscontrati una media di 4 errori per voce contro i 3 della Britannica).,Italian
"[46][47][48] La ricerca di Nature fece notevole scalpore nei media, dai quali Ë stata spesso citata come dimostrazione dell'efficacia dei progetti basati sul crowdsourcing.",Italian
"Secondo un nuovo studio condotto nel 2012 dalla societ‡† Epic e da alcuni ricercatori dell'universit‡† di Oxford, Wikipedia Ë divenuta pi˘ precisa, documentata e aggiornata rispetto alla Britannica.",Italian
"[49][50] Tra il 28 dicembre 2005 e il 10 gennaio 2006 l'edizione in lingua italiana di Wikipedia Ë stata sottoposta a un esperimento da parte del settimanale L'espresso, che ha inserito volutamente quattro errori in altrettante voci dell'enciclopedia (‡Ålvaro Recoba, Ugo Foscolo, Giovanni Spadolini, Georg Hegel) e una voce del tutto inventata su un inesistente poeta di nome Carlo Zamolli.",Italian
La voce ‡Ålvaro Recoba Ë stata corretta in poco pi˘ di un'ora.,Italian
La voce Georg Hegel Ë stata corretta dopo dieci giorni.,Italian
Le altre due voci contenenti gli inserimenti errati e la voce inventata sono state corrette solo dopo l'uscita del settimanale nelle edicole.,Italian
"Come ulteriore esempio una voce intitolata Elia Spallanzani, del tutto inventata, inserita l'8 gennaio 2005 non Ë stata corretta fino al 19 maggio 2006: nel corso della procedura di cancellazione la voce Ë stata modificata in modo da chiarire che si trattava di una biografia immaginaria.",Italian
"Nel suo pamphlet sulla specializzazione, frammentazione e disgregazione del sapere,[51] Lucio Russo conclude: ´Non Ë facile prevedere l'esito dell'esperimento sociologico-culturale di massa di Wikipedia, ma credo che in ogni caso questo tentativo di ricostruire dal basso uno strumento condivisibile di conoscenza, al quale stanno partecipando milioni di volontari di tutto il mondo, costituisca un'esperienza da cui non si potr‡† prescindere in futuro e autorizza qualche timida speranza.ª Wikipedia ha vinto due premi importanti nel maggio 2004: il primo Ë stato un Golden Nica per le Comunit‡† Digitali all'interno del Prix Ars Electronica di Linz in Austria[52], in cui annualmente sono consegnati premi nel campo dell'arte elettronica ed interattiva, dell'animazione al computer, della cultura digitale e della musica.",Italian
Questo premio fu accompagnato da un finanziamento di 10.000 euro e da un invito a presenziare al PAE Cyberarts Festival di quell'anno.,Italian
"Il secondo Ë stato un Webby Award (premio annuale per i migliori siti web) proposto dalla giuria per la categoria ""Comunit‡†"".",Italian
"Wikipedia Ë anche stata nominata per il premio della categoria ""Migliori attivit‡†"".",Italian
Nel settembre 2004 l'edizione giapponese di Wikipedia ha ottenuto un Premio per la Creazione Web dalla Associazione Inserzionisti del Giappone.,Italian
"Questo premio, normalmente consegnato a singole persone che si sono distinte per il loro contributo al web in giapponese, Ë stato ritirato da un collaboratore di lunga data, per conto del progetto.",Italian
"Wikipedia ha ricevuto plausi da fonti giornalistiche quali BBC News, USA Today, The Economist, Newsweek, BusinessWeek, il Chicago Sun-Times, Time Magazine e Wired Magazine[senza†fonte].",Italian
"A dicembre 2005 la Wikipedia in italiano ha ricevuto due premi nell'ambito del Premio WWW 2005, organizzato da Il Sole 24 Ore: Nell'edizione 2007 dello stesso premio si aggiudica la categoria Portali, siti di informazione & community.",Italian
[54] Nel 2009 il lancio di Wikipedia (avvenuto nel 2001) Ë stato inserito da Webby Awards nei 10 momenti pi˘ importanti per Internet nell'ultimo decennio (2000-2009).,Italian
[55] Wikipedia Ë riconosciuta dal Guinness World Records (Guinness dei primati) come la pi˘ grande enciclopedia online[56] e come la pi˘ grande enciclopedia in assoluto.,Italian
"[4] Altri progetti LÄôapprendimento automatico (nella letteratura di lingua anglosassone machine learning) Ë una branca dell'intelligenza artificiale che raccoglie metodi sviluppati negli ultimi decenni del XX secolo in varie comunit‡† scientifiche, sotto diversi nomi quali: statistica computazionale, riconoscimento di pattern, reti neurali artificiali, filtraggio adattivo, teoria dei sistemi dinamici, elaborazione delle immagini, data mining, algoritmi adattivi, ecc; che utilizza metodi statistici per migliorare la performance di un algoritmo nell'identificare pattern nei dati.",Italian
"Nell'ambito dell'informatica, l'apprendimento automatico Ë una variante alla programmazione tradizionale nella quale in una macchina si predispone l'abilit‡† di apprendere qualcosa dai dati in maniera autonoma, senza istruzioni esplicite[1][2].",Italian
"Arthur Samuel, che coniÚ il termine nel 1959[3], in linea di principio identifica due approcci distinti.",Italian
"Il primo metodo, indicato come rete neurale, sviluppa macchine ad apprendimento automatico per impiego generale il cui comportamento Ë appreso da una rete di commutazione connessa casualmente, a seguito di una routine di apprendimento basata su ricompensa e punizione (apprendimento per rinforzo).",Italian
"Il secondo metodo, pi˘ specifico, consiste nel riprodurre l'equivalente di una rete altamente organizzata progettata per imparare solo attivit‡† specifiche.",Italian
"La seconda procedura, che necessita di supervisione e richiede la riprogrammazione per ogni nuova applicazione, Ë molto pi˘ efficiente dal punto di vista computazionale.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico Ë strettamente legato al riconoscimento di pattern e alla teoria computazionale dell'apprendimento[4] ed esplora lo studio e la costruzione di algoritmi che possano apprendere da un insieme di dati e fare delle predizioni su questi,[5] costruendo in modo induttivo un modello basato su dei campioni.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico viene impiegato in quei campi dell'informatica nei quali progettare e programmare algoritmi espliciti Ë impraticabile; tra le possibili applicazioni citiamo il filtraggio delle email per evitare spam, l'individuazione di intrusioni in una rete o di intrusi che cercano di violare dati,[6] il riconoscimento ottico dei caratteri[7], i motori di ricerca e la visione artificiale.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico Ë collegato, e spesso si sovrappone, alla statistica computazionale, che si occupa dell'elaborazione di predizioni tramite l'uso di computer.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico Ë anche fortemente legato all'ottimizzazione matematica, che fornisce metodi, teorie e domini di applicazione a questo campo.",Italian
"Per usi commerciali, l'apprendimento automatico Ë conosciuto come analisi predittiva.",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico si sviluppa con lo studio dell'intelligenza artificiale, e vi Ë strettamente collegato: infatti gi‡† dai primi tentativi di definire l'intelligenza artificiale come disciplina accademica, alcuni ricercatori si erano mostrati interessati alla possibilit‡† che le macchine imparassero dai dati.",Italian
"Questi ricercatori, in particolare Marvin Minsky, Arthur Samuel e Frank Rosenblatt, provarono ad avvicinarsi al problema sia attraverso vari metodi formali, sia con quelle che vengono definite reti neurali nei tardi anni '50.",Italian
"Le reti neurali erano allora costituite da singoli percettroni e da modelli matematici derivati dal modello lineare generalizzato della statistica, come l'ADALINE di Widrow[8][9].",Italian
"Si provÚ a sfruttare anche ragionamenti probabilistici, in particolare nelle diagnosi mediche automatiche[10].",Italian
"Sempre negli anni '50, Alan Turing propose l'idea di una macchina che apprende, ovvero in grado di imparare e dunque diventare intelligente.",Italian
La proposta specifica di Turing anticipa gli algoritmi genetici[11].,Italian
"Tuttavia gi‡† dalla met‡† degli anni '50 lo studio dell'intelligenza artificiale si stava concentrando su approcci logici di tipo knowledge-based, nota oggi sotto il nome di GOFAI, causando un distacco tra lo studio dell'IA e quello dell'apprendimento automatico.",Italian
Sistemi di tipo probabilistico erano invasi di problemi sia teoretici sia pratici in termini di acquisizione e rappresentazione dei dati[10].,Italian
"Negli anni Ottanta, i sistemi esperti dominavano il campo dell'IA, e i sistemi basati sulla statistica non venivano pi˘ studiati[12].",Italian
"Lo studio dell'apprendimento simbolico e knowledge-based continuÚ nell'ambito dell'IA, portando a sviluppare la programmazione logica induttiva, ma ora la ricerca pi˘ prettamente statistica si svolgeva al di fuori del campo vero e proprio dell'intelligenza artificiale, nel riconoscimento di pattern e nell'information retrieval[10].",Italian
"Un altro motivo per cui lo studio dell'apprendimento automatico fu abbandonato fu la pubblicazione del libro Perceptrons: an introduction to computational geometry di Marvin Minsky e Seymour Papert, che vi descrivevano alcune delle limitazioni dei percettroni e delle reti neurali.",Italian
"La ricerca sulle reti neurali subÏ un significativo rallentamento a causa dell'interpretazione del libro, che le descriveva come intrinsecamente limitate[13][14].",Italian
"Anche la linea di ricerca sulle reti neurali continuÚ al di fuori del campo dell'IA, portata avanti da ricercatori provenienti da altre discipline quali Hopfield, Rumelhart, Hinton e Fukushima.",Italian
Il loro successo principale fu a met‡† degli anni '80 con la riscoperta della backpropagation[10] e della self-organization[15].,Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico, sviluppatosi come campo di studi separato dall'IA classica, cominciÚ a rifiorire negli anni '90.",Italian
Il suo obiettivo cambiÚ dall'ottenere l'intelligenza artificiale ad affrontare problemi risolvibili di natura pratica.,Italian
"Distolse inoltre la propria attenzione dagli approcci simbolici che aveva ereditato dall'IA, e si diresse verso metodi e modelli presi in prestito dalla statistica e dalla teoria della probabilit‡†[12].",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico ha inoltre beneficiato dalla nascita di Internet, che ha reso l'informazione digitale pi˘ facilmente reperibile e distribuibile.",Italian
"Tom M. Mitchell ha fornito la definizione pi˘ citata di apprendimento automatico nel suo libro ""Machine Learning"": ""Si dice che un programma apprende dall'esperienza E con riferimento a alcune classi di compiti T e con misurazione della performance P, se le sue performance nel compito T, come misurato da P, migliorano con l'esperienza E.""[16] In poche parole, si potrebbe semplificare dicendo che un programma apprende se c'Ë un miglioramento delle prestazioni dopo un compito svolto.",Italian
"Questa definizione di Mitchell Ë rilevante poichÈ fornisce una definizione operativa dell'apprendimento automatico, invece che in termini cognitivi.",Italian
"Fornendo questa definizione, Mitchell di fatto segue la proposta che Alan Turing fece nel suo articolo ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", sostituendo la domanda ""Le macchine possono pensare?""",Italian
"con la domanda ""Le macchine possono fare quello che noi (in quanto entit‡† pensanti) possiamo fare?""[17].",Italian
"L'obiettivo principe dell'apprendimento automatico Ë che una macchina sia in grado di generalizzare dalla propria esperienza[18], ossia che sia in grado di svolgere ragionamenti induttivi.",Italian
"In questo contesto, per generalizzazione si intende l'abilit‡† di una macchina di portare a termine in maniera accurata esempi o compiti nuovi, che non ha mai affrontato, dopo aver fatto esperienza su un insieme di dati di apprendimento.",Italian
"Gli esempi di addestramento (in inglese chiamati training examples) si assume provengano da una qualche distribuzione di probabilit‡†, generalmente sconosciuta e considerata rappresentativa dello spazio delle occorrenze del fenomeno da apprendere; la macchina ha il compito di costruire un modello probabilistico generale dello spazio delle occorrenze, in maniera tale da essere in grado di produrre previsioni sufficientemente accurate quando sottoposta a nuovi casi.",Italian
L'analisi computazionale degli algoritmi di apprendimento automatico e delle loro prestazioni Ë una branca dell'Informatica teorica chiamata teoria dell'apprendimento.,Italian
"Dato che gli esempi di addestramento sono insiemi finiti di dati e non c'Ë modo di sapere l'evoluzione futura di un modello, la teoria dell'apprendimento non offre alcuna garanzia sulle prestazioni degli algoritmi.",Italian
"D'altro canto, Ë piuttosto comune che tali prestazioni siano vincolate da limiti probabilistici.",Italian
Il bias-variance tradeoff Ë uno dei modi di quantificare l'errore di generalizzazione.,Italian
"AffinchÈ la generalizzazione offra le migliori prestazioni possibili, la complessit‡† dell'ipotesi induttiva deve essere pari alla complessit‡† della funzione sottostante i dati.",Italian
"Se l'ipotesi Ë meno complessa della funzione, allora il modello manifesta underfitting.",Italian
"Quando la complessit‡† del modello viene aumentata in risposta, allora l'errore di apprendimento diminuisce.",Italian
"Al contrario invece se l'ipotesi Ë troppo complessa, allora il modello manifesta overfitting e la generalizzazione sar‡† pi˘ scarsa[19].",Italian
"Oltre ai limiti di prestazioni, i teorici dell'apprendimento studiano la complessit‡† temporale e la fattibilit‡† dell'apprendimento stesso.",Italian
Una computazione Ë considerata fattibile se puÚ essere svolta in tempo polinomiale.,Italian
"I compiti dell'apprendimento automatico vengono tipicamente classificati in tre ampie categorie, a seconda della natura del ""segnale"" utilizzato per l'apprendimento o del ""feedback"" disponibile al sistema di apprendimento.",Italian
"Queste categorie, anche dette paradigmi, sono:[10] A met‡† strada tra l'apprendimento supervisionato e quello non supervisionato c'Ë l'apprendimento semi-supervisionato, nel quale l'insegnante fornisce un dataset incompleto per l'allenamento, cioË un insieme di dati per l'allenamento tra i quali ci sono dati senza il rispettivo output desiderato.",Italian
"La trasduzione Ë un caso speciale di questo principio, nel quale l'intero insieme delle istanze del problema Ë noto durante l'apprendimento, eccetto la parte degli output desiderati che Ë mancante.",Italian
Un'altra categorizzazione dei compiti dell'apprendimento automatico si rileva quando si considera l'output desiderato del sistema di apprendimento automatico.,Italian
[20] L'apprendimento automatico e la statistica sono discipline strettamente collegate.,Italian
"Secondo Michael I. Jordan, le idee dell'apprendimento automatico, dai principi metodologici agli strumenti teorici, sono stati sviluppati prima in statistica[22].",Italian
Jordan ha anche suggerito il termine data science come nome con cui chiamare l'intero campo di studi[22].,Italian
"Leo Breiman ha distinto due paradigmi statistici di modellazione: modello basato sui dati e modello basato sugli algoritmi[23], dove ""modello basato sugli algoritmi"" indica approssimativamente algoritmi di apprendimento automatico come la foresta casuale.",Italian
"Alcuni statistici hanno adottato metodi provenienti dall'apprendimento automatico, il che ha portato alla creazione di una disciplina combinata chiamata ""apprendimento statistico""[24].",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico viene a volte unito al data mining,[25] che si focalizza maggiormente sull'analisi esplorativa dei dati ed utilizza principalmente il paradigma di apprendimento chiamato ""apprendimento non supervisionato""[26].",Italian
"Invece, l'apprendimento automatico puÚ essere anche supervisionato[27].",Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico e il data mining infatti si sovrappongono in modo significativo, ma mentre l'apprendimento automatico si concentra sulla previsione basata su propriet‡† note apprese dai dati, il data mining si concentra sulla scoperta di propriet‡† prima sconosciute nei dati.",Italian
"Il data mining sfrutta i metodi dell'apprendimento automatico, ma con obiettivi differenti; d'altro canto, l'apprendimento automatico utilizza i metodi di data mining come metodi di apprendimento non supervisionato o come passi di preprocessing per aumentare l'accuratezza dell'apprendimento.",Italian
"Gran parte della confusione tra le due comunit‡† di ricerca scaturisce dall'assunzione di base del loro operato: nell'apprendimento automatico, le prestazioni sono generalmente valutate in base all'abilit‡† di riprodurre conoscenza gi‡† acquisita, mentre in data mining il compito chiave Ë la scoperta di conoscenza che prima non si aveva.",Italian
L'apprendimento automatico ha legami molto stretti con l'ottimizzazione: molti problemi di apprendimento sono formulati come la minimizzazione di una qualche funzione di costo su un insieme di esempi di apprendimento.,Italian
La funzione di costo (o funzione di perdita) rappresenta la discrepanza tra le previsioni del modello che si sta addestrando e le istanze del problema reale.,Italian
"Le differenze tra i due campi (l'apprendimento automatico e l'ottimizzazione) sorgono dall'obiettivo della generalizzazione: mentre gli algoritmi di ottimizzazione possono minimizzare la perdita su un insieme di apprendimento, l'apprendimento automatico si preoccupa di minimizzare la perdita su campioni mai visti dalla macchina[28].",Italian
"La risoluzione automatica di problemi avviene, nel campo dell'informatica, in due modi differenti: tramite paradigmi di hard computing o tramite paradigmi di soft computing.",Italian
Per hard computing si intende la risoluzione di un problema tramite l'esecuzione di un algoritmo ben definito e decidibile.,Italian
"La maggior parte dei paradigmi di hard computing sono metodi ormai consolidati, ma presentano alcuni lati negativi: infatti richiedono sempre un modello analitico preciso e definibile, e spesso un alto tempo di computazione.",Italian
"Le tecniche di soft computing d'altro canto antepongono il guadagno nella comprensione del comportamento di un sistema a scapito della precisione, spesso non necessaria.",Italian
I paradigmi di soft computing si basano su due principi[29]: L'apprendimento automatico si avvale delle tecniche di soft computing.,Italian
"La programmazione logica induttiva (anche ILP, dall'inglese inductive logic programming) Ë un approccio all'apprendimento di regole che usa la programmazione logica come rappresentazione uniforme per gli esempi di input, per la conoscenza di base della macchina, e per le ipotesi.",Italian
"Data una codifica della (nota) conoscenza di base e un insieme di esempi rappresentati come fatti in una base di dati logica, un sistema ILP deriva un programma logico ipotetico da cui conseguono tutti gli esempi positivi, e nessuno di quelli negativi.",Italian
"La programmazione induttiva Ë un campo simile che considera ogni tipo di linguaggio di programmazione per rappresentare le ipotesi invece che soltanto la programmazione logica, come ad esempio programmi funzionali.",Italian
L'albero di decisione Ë un metodo di apprendimento per approssimazione di una funzione obiettivo discreta in cui l'elemento che apprende Ë rappresentato da un albero di decisione.,Italian
Gli alberi di decisione possono essere rappresentati da un insieme di regole if-else per migliorare la leggibilit‡† umana.,Italian
"L'apprendimento automatico basato su regole di associazione Ë un metodo di apprendimento che identifica, apprende ed evolve delle ""regole"" con l'intento di immagazzinare, manipolare e applicare conoscenza.",Italian
La caratteristica principale di questo tipo di apprendimento Ë l'identificazione ed utilizzo di un insieme di regole relazionali che rappresenta nel suo insieme la conoscenza catturata dal sistema.,Italian
CiÚ si pone in controtendenza con altri tipi di apprendimento automatico che normalmente identificano un singolo modello che puÚ essere applicato universalmente ad ogni istanza per riuscire a fare su di essa una previsione[30].,Italian
Gli approcci dell'apprendimento basato su regole di associazione includono il sistema immunitario artificiale.,Italian
Una rete neurale artificiale Ë un sistema adattivo che cambia la sua struttura basata su informazioni esterne o interne che scorrono attraverso la rete durante la fase di apprendimento.,Italian
In termini pratici le reti neurali sono strutture non-lineari di dati statistici organizzate come strumenti di modellazione.,Italian
Esse possono essere utilizzate per simulare relazioni complesse tra ingressi e uscite che altre funzioni analitiche non riescono a rappresentare.,Italian
Inoltre esse sono robuste agli errori presenti nel training data.,Italian
Gli algoritmi genetici forniscono un approccio all'apprendimento che Ë liberamente ispirato all'evoluzione simulata.,Italian
La ricerca di una soluzione del problema inizia con una popolazione di soluzioni iniziale.,Italian
"I membri della popolazione attuale danno luogo a una popolazione di nuova generazione per mezzo di operazioni quali la mutazione casuale e crossover, che sono modellati sui processi di evoluzione biologica.",Italian
"Ad ogni passo, le soluzioni della popolazione attuale sono valutate rispetto a una determinata misura di fitness, con le ipotesi pi˘ adatte selezionate probabilisticamente come semi per la produzione della prossima generazione.",Italian
Gli algoritmi genetici sono stati applicati con successo a una variet‡† di compiti di apprendimento e di altri problemi di ottimizzazione.,Italian
"Ad esempio, essi sono stati usati per imparare raccolte di norme per il controllo del robot e per ottimizzare la topologia dei parametri di apprendimento per reti neurali artificiali.",Italian
Il ragionamento bayesiano fornisce un approccio probabilistico di inferenza.,Italian
Esso si basa sul presupposto che le quantit‡† di interesse sono disciplinate da distribuzioni di probabilit‡† e che le decisioni ottimali possono essere prese a seguito dell'analisi di queste probabilit‡† insieme ai dati osservati.,Italian
"Nell'ambito dell'apprendimento automatico, la teoria Bayesiana Ë importante perchÈ fornisce un approccio quantitativo per valutare le prove a sostegno dell'ipotesi alternativa.",Italian
Il Ragionamento bayesiano fornisce la base per l'apprendimento negli algoritmi che manipolano direttamente le probabilit‡†.,Italian
"Macchine a vettori di supporto (Support Vector Machine, SVM) sono un insieme di metodi di apprendimento supervisionato usati per la classificazione e la regressione di pattern.",Italian
"Dato un insieme di esempi di addestramento, ciascuno contrassegnato come appartenente a due possibili categorie, un algoritmo di addestramento SVM costruisce un modello in grado di prevedere a quale categoria deve appartenere un nuovo esempio di input.",Italian
"La discesa dei prezzi per l'hardware e lo sviluppo di GPU per uso personale negli ultimi anni hanno contribuito allo sviluppo del concetto di apprendimento profondo, che consiste nello sviluppare livelli nascosti multipli nelle reti neurali artificiali.",Italian
Questo approccio tenta di modellizzare il modo in cui il cervello umano processa luce e suoni e li interpreta in vista e udito.,Italian
Alcune delle applicazioni pi˘ affermate dell'apprendimento profondo sono la visione artificiale e il riconoscimento vocale[31].,Italian
"La cluster analisi, o clustering, Ë in grado di rilevare similarit‡† strutturali tra le osservazioni di un dataset attraverso l'assegnazione di un insieme di osservazioni in sottogruppi (cluster) di elementi tra loro omogenei[1].",Italian
"Il clustering Ë un metodo di apprendimento non supervisionato, e una tecnica comune per l'analisi statistica dei dati.",Italian
Tutti i sistemi di riconoscimento vocale di maggior successo utilizzano metodi di apprendimento automatico.,Italian
"Ad esempio, il SPHINXsystem[32] impara le strategie di altoparlanti specifici per riconoscere i suoni primitivi (fonemi) e le parole del segnale vocale osservato.",Italian
"Metodi di apprendimento basati su reti neurali e su modelli di Markov nascosti sono efficaci per la personalizzazione automatica di vocabolari, caratteristiche del microfono, rumore di fondo, ecc.",Italian
Metodi di apprendimento automatico sono stati usati per addestrare i veicoli controllati da computer.,Italian
"Ad esempio, il sistema ALVINN[33] ha usato le sue strategie per imparare a guidare senza assistenza a 70 miglia all'ora per 90 miglia su strade pubbliche, tra le altre auto.",Italian

Viel Spaﬂ beim Lernen und wir sehen uns bald in einer weiteren Lektion.,German
"Es war einmal das goldene Brot in einem winzigen Dorf, in dem eine Frau namens Marion lebte.",German
Mit ihrer einzigen Tochter war Narcisa Marion ‰uﬂerst bescheiden und s¸ﬂ.,German
Narcisa war jedoch genau das Gegenteil.,German
"Sie sehen, sie war unbeschreiblich schˆn.",German
Sie war wie ein Lebender.,German
"Puppe und der am¸santeste Teil ist, dass sie sich bis zum ‡Ñuﬂersten geliebt hat.",German
"Hilf mir, das Brot zu backen, huh, auf keinen Fall, Mama, die Mehlm‰dchen, all meine hellen und funkelnden Augen.",German
"narcisa, w¸rdest du mir helfen, diese Samen zu pflanzen?",German
Warum sollte ich das tun?,German
Was habe ich den ganzen Schmutz an meinen schˆnen Fingern?,German
"Schlimmer, wenn es gut auf mein Gesicht ging, war das das Problem mit narcisa.",German
"Sie hielt sich f¸r zu groﬂ, um irgendeine Arbeit zu verrichten.",German
"Viele Freier kamen, um in der Ehe um Narzissenhand zu bitten.",German
"Da ihre Schˆnheit weit und breit bekannt war, aber sie alle sehr grob zur¸ckwies, warum hast du diese M‰nner gestern weggeschickt?",German
Sie schienen nett zu sein.,German
"Du kannst es nicht ernst meinen, Mutter eine von ihnen.",German
"hatte so kleine Augen fast wie die eines Vogels und der andere hatte eine riesige Nase, ich w¸rde nicht in seiner N‰he sein wollen.",German
"Als er nieste, oh oh und die letzte Station, nein, ich will nicht mehr hˆren, alles was ich sehen konnte war, dass diese M‰nner wirklich nett waren, meine Liebe, du musst diese Schˆnheit kennen.",German
"ist nicht alles Mutter, die du erkennen musst, dass ich jemanden wie einen Prinzen oder einen Ritter verdiene.",German
"Oh je, eines Nachts, als sie schlief, saﬂ ihre Mutter an ihrer Seite und beobachtete sie.",German
"Mein liebes Kind, du bist so schˆn und lieblich, aber dir ist nichts anderes wichtig als deine Schˆnheit.",German
In diesem Moment begann Narzisse im Schlaf zu lachen.,German
"Ihre Mutter war ‰uﬂerst ¸berrascht, wie schˆn sie sein musste, als Narzisse am n‰chsten Morgen einen wirklich lustigen Traum hatte.",German
"Ich bin aufgewacht, sie hat alle gel‰chelt und hier gekichert, Schatz, sag mir, wovon hast du getr‰umt?",German
"Letzte Nacht, Mama, es war so ein erstaunlicher Traum, dass du weiﬂt, dass dieser Prinz auf mich zukam.",German
"und sagte, dass er mich heiraten wollte, er war in einem goldenen Wagen gekommen und er war von oben bis unten gekleidet und auch gold, was f¸r ein dummer Traum.",German
"und du weiﬂt, das Beste daran war, als ich in meinem Hochzeitskleid war, das nat¸rlich auch aus Gold war.",German
Nat¸rlich starrten alle nur mich an.,German
"Narcisa, an diesem Traum ist nichts Erstaunliches.",German
"Es war eine sehr egoistische Traummutter, du weiﬂt nicht, was du sagst.",German
"Dieser Traum hat mir klar gemacht, dass ich Essen brauche, das viel grˆﬂer ist als die Art, die ich hier zu Hause esse.",German
Brot aus Gold.,German
"Denken Sie nur an diese arme Narzissenmutter, die so besorgt um ihre Tochter war und wie.",German
"Sie w¸rde ihr Leben an dem Tag leben, an dem zwei Freunde kamen, um Narzissenmutter zu besuchen.",German
Sie waren Mellie und Terry.,German
"Die drei waren seit Ewigkeiten Freunde, aber Terry und Ellie hatten beide ein Geheimnis.",German
"Waren magische Wesen etwas, von dem Narcisses Mutter nichts ¸ber Terry Melli wusste?",German
"Oh, es ist so schˆn, dich zu sehen, es ist schon sehr lange her.",German
Wie war es dir?,German
Ich war sehr gut.,German
"Ich w‰re besser gewesen, wenn nur was w‰re, wenn nur meine Tochter Narcisa etwas verst‰ndnisvoller w‰re.",German
"Marian erz‰hlte Mellie und Terry alles ¸ber Narcisa und wie sie sich Sorgen um sie machte, die sie essen mˆchte Brot aus Gold Was mache ich mit ihr gut, vielleicht wenn ihr Traum wahr wird?",German
"das w‰re wunderbar, w‰re es nicht gut, egal ich denke mit der Zeit wird sie wachsen, um zu lernen, lass uns ¸ber etwas anderes reden.",German
"Jetzt sp‰ter winkten Mellie und Terry ihrem alten Freund zum Abschied und gingen weg und l‰chelten sich in dieser Nacht heimlich an, Mutter und Tochter.",German
"Ich hoffe, mein Traum wird wahr, du weiﬂt, oh Narcisa am n‰chsten Tag, als Narcisa und ihre Mutter drauﬂen in ihrem Garten wunderschˆn waren.",German
Der goldene Wagen kam auf sie zugeritten.,German
Er war mit Edelsteinen und Diamanten besetzt und sah ‰uﬂerst atemberaubend aus.,German
"Als es aufhˆrte, kam ein gutaussehender Mann heraus und sah Narcisa an.",German
"Sie war vˆllig ¸berrascht, wie gutaussehend er war, mein Traum wird tats‰chlich wahr, ‰hm.",German
"Was f¸r ein Hallo, ich bin hierher gekommen, um nach Narzissenhand in der Ehe zu fragen, aber woher kennst du ihren Namen und wer bist du?",German
"Ich bin schrecklich, der Engel des Gl¸cks.",German
Der Name und die Schˆnheit Ihrer Tochter sind auf der ganzen Welt bekannt.,German
"Ich habe Ihnen ein Geschenk gebracht, aber Sie kennen ihn kaum.",German
Sie kˆnnen nicht mit ihm gehen.,German
"Oh dumm, er ist reich und gutaussehend.",German
Was will ich mehr?,German
Ich akzeptiere deinen Vorschlag.,German
"und damit stieg sie in seinen Wagen und ohne sich von ihrer Mutter zu verabschieden, ritt sie mit dem Engel davon, als sie unterwegs waren.",German
"Der Wagen betrat plˆtzlich ein magisches Portal, das durch ein st¸rmisches Gebiet fuhr.",German
Der Wagen rumpelte gewaltig herum und Narzissa.,German
"Ich war sehr ver‰ngstigt, mach dir keine Sorgen, mein Lieber.",German
"All dies wird bald vorbei sein, als er sagte, dass der Wagen durch ein anderes Portal fuhr und die Auffahrt erreichte.",German
"Von einem riesigen und pr‰chtigen goldenen Schloss war Narcisa erstaunt ¸ber die Schˆnheit, die sie sah.",German
"Ich wusste, dass ich so viele Reicht¸mer verdiene.",German
"Ich wusste, dass Sie es mˆgen w¸rden.",German
"Alles, was Sie wollen, finden Sie hier, von den schˆnsten Kleidern bis zu den leckersten Lebensmitteln In meinem Palast, wo ich gerade von Essen spreche, bin ich nach dieser Fahrt wirklich hungrig.",German
Ich bin am Verhungern.,German
Kann ich irgendetwas von diesem leckeren Essen hier haben?,German
Fleisch stinkt nach Melissa.,German
"Sie wird dir alles besorgen, was du willst.",German
"Ich habe so viel ¸ber dich gehˆrt Ich hole dir etwas zu essen, oh danke, sie gingen ins Esszimmer und dort auf dem Tisch war das erstaunlichste Essen, das Narcisa jemals erstaunlich gesehen hatte, weil es die Marmeladen sind, die gemacht wurden.",German
"Von Rubinen sind die Salate von Smaragden und das Brot dort dr¸ben aus goldgoldenem Brot, wie schˆn diese Marmelade mit dem Brot aussehen und schmecken wird, mit dem sie eine Scheibe genommen hat.",German
"Rubinmarmelade darauf und nahm einen groﬂen Bissen das ist so heiﬂ, dass ich nicht so gut essen kann, es ist Brot aus Gold und das feinste auch, aber wenn du es nicht essen kannst, sollte ich dir Silberbrot Silber holen, huh warum nicht du isst.",German
"etwas anderes, aber ich mˆchte normales Brotbrot, das ich essen kann.",German
Siehst du nicht so aus wie die zuk¸nftige Frau meines Vaters?,German
Es ist kalt.,German
"Du musst nur die besten Narzissen essen, die ich mir bei all dem Essen angesehen habe.",German
"aber war mit gebrochenem Herzen f¸r alles, was dort ungenieﬂbar war.",German
Sie fing bald an zu weinen.,German
"Ich will das nicht, aber das Essen ist wirklich gut.",German
"Hier probieren Sie ein paar goldene Kartoffeln, sie sind wirklich gut und nachdem Sie mit mir verheiratet sind.",German
Du musst das alles essen.,German
"Ich dachte, du magst ausgefallene Dinge.",German
"Nein, ich will dich nicht heiraten.",German
Ich will nach Hause gehen.,German
zu meiner Mutter lass mich nach Hause gehen Melissa und Terrence sahen sich an und zwinkerten gut.,German
"Wenn es wirklich das ist, was du willst, dann bringe ich dich nach Hause.",German
Angst nahm das Weinen und Ungl¸ck.,German
"Narcis zu Hause in der Kutsche begann sie tief ¸ber die Entscheidungen nachzudenken, die sie getroffen hatte, als sie zu Hause ankam.",German
"Sie rannte, um ihre Mutter zu umarmen, die traurig im Haus saﬂ, noch die Schwester meiner s¸ﬂen Tochter.",German
"Ich dachte, ich w¸rde dich nie wieder sehen.",German
"Oh Mama, ich liebe dich so sehr und du hattest rechtes Aussehen und Reichtum ist nicht alles, was das Goldbrot nutzlos war, da ich es und den Mann nicht essen konnte.",German
"Er war gutaussehend, er hat sich ¸berhaupt nicht um mich gek¸mmert, aber mein Lieber, weiﬂt du, dass du genau so mit anderen umgegangen bist?",German
"Ich weiﬂ, dass es mir so leid tut, wie ich mich verhalten habe, Mama.",German
"Oh nein, es ist in Ordnung, seit du es gesehen hast.",German
"Was dein Fehler war, lass uns dir von diesem Tag an etwas Schˆnes geben.",German
"narcisa ‰nderte ihre art und weise sie k‰mpfte zuerst, aber langsam und geduldig wurde sie eines tages viel netter mellie und terry kamen marian wieder entgegen oh hallo ihr zwei, also sag uns marian.",German
"Wie' s Narzissmus jetzt erz‰hlt Marian beiden alles, was passiert war und sie hat sich seit dieser Zeit so sehr ver‰ndert.",German
"Hat sie, ich denke, sie w¸rde jetzt kein Goldbrot mehr wollen, oder?",German
"Terry, du siehst tats‰chlich ein bisschen wie dieser Engel aus, aber was sehe ich, wie kˆnntest du er sein?",German
Ihr zwei seid so nett,German
